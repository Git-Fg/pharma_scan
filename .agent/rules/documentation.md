# Documentation Guidelines

* **`dartdoc`:** Write `dartdoc`-style comments for all public APIs.

## Documentation Philosophy

* **Comment wisely:** Use comments to explain why the code is written a certain way, not what the code does. The code itself should be self-explanatory.
* **Document for the user:** Write documentation with the reader in mind. If you had a question and found the answer, add it to the documentation where you first looked. This ensures the documentation answers real-world questions.
* **No useless documentation:** If the documentation only restates the obvious from the code's name, it's not helpful. Good documentation provides context and explains what isn't immediately apparent.
* **Consistency is key:** Use consistent terminology throughout your documentation.

## Commenting Style

* **Use `///` for doc comments:** This allows documentation generation tools to pick them up.
* **Start with a single-sentence summary:** The first sentence should be a concise, user-centric summary ending with a period.
* **Separate the summary:** Add a blank line after the first sentence to create a separate paragraph. This helps tools create better summaries.
* **Avoid redundancy:** Don't repeat information that's obvious from the code's context, like the class name or signature.
* **Don't document both getter and setter:** For properties with both, only document one. The documentation tool will treat them as a single field.

## Writing Style

* **Be brief:** Write concisely.
* **Avoid jargon and acronyms:** Don't use abbreviations unless they are widely understood.
* **Use Markdown sparingly:** Avoid excessive markdown and never use HTML for formatting.
* **Use backticks for code:** Enclose code blocks in backtick fences, and specify the language.

## What to Document

* **Public APIs are a priority:** Always document public APIs.
* **Consider private APIs:** It's a good idea to document private APIs as well.
* **Library-level comments are helpful:** Consider adding a doc comment at the library level to provide a general overview.
* **Include code samples:** Where appropriate, add code samples to illustrate usage.
* **Explain parameters, return values, and exceptions:** Use prose to describe what a function expects, what it returns, and what errors it might throw.
* **Place doc comments before annotations:** Documentation should come before any metadata annotations.
