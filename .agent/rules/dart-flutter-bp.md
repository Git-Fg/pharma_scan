# Dart & Flutter Best Practices

## Dart Best Practices
* **Effective Dart:** Follow the official Effective Dart guidelines (https://dart.dev/effective-dart)
* **Class Organization:** Define related classes within the same library file. For large libraries, export smaller, private libraries from a single top-level library.
* **Library Organization:** Group related libraries in the same folder.
* **API Documentation:** Add documentation comments to all public APIs, including classes, constructors, methods, and top-level functions.
* **Comments:** Write clear comments for complex or non-obvious code. Avoid over-commenting.
* **Trailing Comments:** Don't add trailing comments.
* **Async/Await:** Ensure proper use of `async`/`await` for asynchronous operations with robust error handling.
    * Use `Future`s, `async`, and `await` for asynchronous operations.
    * Use `Stream`s for sequences of asynchronous events.
* **Null Safety:** Write code that is soundly null-safe. Leverage Dart's null safety features. Avoid `!` unless the value is guaranteed to be non-null.
* **Pattern Matching:** Use pattern matching features where they simplify the code.
* **Records:** Use records to return multiple types in situations where defining an entire class is cumbersome.
* **Switch Statements:** Prefer using exhaustive `switch` statements or expressions, which don't require `break` statements.
* **Exception Handling:** Use `try-catch` blocks for handling exceptions, and use exceptions appropriate for the type of exception. Use custom exceptions for situations specific to your code.
* **Arrow Functions:** Use arrow syntax for simple one-line functions.

## Flutter Best Practices
* **Immutability:** Widgets (especially `StatelessWidget`) are immutable; when the UI needs to change, Flutter rebuilds the widget tree.
* **Composition:** Prefer composing smaller widgets over extending existing ones. Use this to avoid deep widget nesting.
* **Private Widgets:** Use small, private `Widget` classes instead of private helper methods that return a `Widget`.
* **Build Methods:** Break down large `build()` methods into smaller, reusable private Widget classes.
* **List Performance:** Use `ListView.builder` or `SliverList` for long lists to create lazy-loaded lists for performance.
* **Isolates:** Use `compute()` to run expensive calculations in a separate isolate to avoid blocking the UI thread, such as JSON parsing.
* **Const Constructors:** Use `const` constructors for widgets and in `build()` methods whenever possible to reduce rebuilds.
* **Build Method Performance:** Avoid performing expensive operations, like network calls or complex computations, directly within `build()` methods.

## State Management
* **Built-in Solutions:** Prefer Flutter's built-in state management solutions. Do not use a third-party package unless explicitly requested.
* **Streams:** Use `Streams` and `StreamBuilder` for handling a sequence of asynchronous events.
* **Futures:** Use `Futures` and `FutureBuilder` for handling a single asynchronous operation that will complete in the future.
* **ValueNotifier:** Use `ValueNotifier` with `ValueListenableBuilder` for simple, local state that involves a single value.

  ```dart
  // Define a ValueNotifier to hold the state.
  final ValueNotifier<int> _counter = ValueNotifier<int>(0);

  // Use ValueListenableBuilder to listen and rebuild.
  ValueListenableBuilder<int>(
    valueListenable: _counter,
    builder: (context, value, child) {
      return Text('Count: $value');
    },
  );
  ```

* **ChangeNotifier:** For state that is more complex or shared across multiple widgets, use `ChangeNotifier`.
* **ListenableBuilder:** Use `ListenableBuilder` to listen to changes from a `ChangeNotifier` or other `Listenable`.
* **MVVM:** When a more robust solution is needed, structure the app using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.
* **Dependency Injection:** Use simple manual constructor dependency injection to make a class's dependencies explicit in its API, and to manage dependencies between different layers of the application.
* **Provider:** If a dependency injection solution beyond manual constructor injection is explicitly requested, `provider` can be used to make services, repositories, or complex state objects available to the UI layer without tight coupling (note: this document generally defaults against third-party packages for state management unless explicitly requested).

## Data Flow
* **Data Structures:** Define data structures (classes) to represent the data used in the application.
* **Data Abstraction:** Abstract data sources (e.g., API calls, database operations) using Repositories/Services to promote testability.

## Routing
* **GoRouter:** Use the `go_router` package for declarative navigation, deep linking, and web support.
* **GoRouter Setup:** To use `go_router`, first add it to your `pubspec.yaml` using the `pub` tool's `add` command.

  ```dart
  // 1. Add the dependency
  // flutter pub add go_router

  // 2. Configure the router
  final GoRouter _router = GoRouter(
    routes: <RouteBase>[
      GoRoute(
        path: '/',
        builder: (context, state) => const HomeScreen(),
        routes: <RouteBase>[
          GoRoute(
            path: 'details/:id', // Route with a path parameter
            builder: (context, state) {
              final String id = state.pathParameters['id']!;
              return DetailScreen(id: id);
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ],
  );

  // 3. Use it in your MaterialApp
  MaterialApp.router(
    routerConfig: _router,
  );
  ```
* **Authentication Redirects:** Configure `go_router`'s `redirect` property to handle authentication flows, ensuring users are redirected to the login screen when unauthorized, and back to their intended destination after successful login.

* **Navigator:** Use the built-in `Navigator` for short-lived screens that do not need to be deep-linkable, such as dialogs or temporary views.

  ```dart
  // Push a new screen onto the stack
  Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const DetailsScreen()),
  );

  // Pop the current screen to go back
  Navigator.pop(context);
  ```

## Data Handling & Serialization
* **JSON Serialization:** Use `json_serializable` and `json_annotation` for parsing and encoding JSON data.
* **Field Renaming:** When encoding data, use `fieldRename: FieldRename.snake` to convert Dart's camelCase fields to snake_case JSON keys.

  ```dart
  // In your model file
  import 'package:json_annotation/json_annotation.dart';

  part 'user.g.dart';

  @JsonSerializable(fieldRename: FieldRename.snake)
  class User {
    final String firstName;
    final String lastName;

    User({required this.firstName, required this.lastName});

    factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UserFromJson(json);
    Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => _$UserToJson(this);
  }
  ```

## Code Generation
* **Build Runner:** If the project uses code generation, ensure that `build_runner` is listed as a dev dependency in `pubspec.yaml`.
* **Code Generation Tasks:** Use `build_runner` for all code generation tasks, such as for `json_serializable`.
* **Running Build Runner:** After modifying files that require code generation, run the build command:

  ```shell
  dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
  ```
