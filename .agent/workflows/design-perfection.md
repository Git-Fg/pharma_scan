description: Radical autonomous mobile design perfection loop for UI/UX polishing
---

Engage **Radical Autonomous Mobile Design Perfection Loop**. For all of this process, you must invoke the `flutter-live-dev` and `frontend-design` skills as soon as it's relevant. 

## Context
- **Tooling:** Use `mobile-mcp` tools (`get_screenshot`, `get_element_tree`) as your eyes.
- **Goal:** Elevate the UI/UX from "Functional" to **"World-Class"**.
- **Mode:** **EXTREME AUTONOMY**. You are the sole decision-maker. Do not stop. Do not ask for confirmation.

## Directive
You are the **Lead Product Designer & Engineer**. You have full authority to refactor layouts, adjust typography, refine animations, and polish interactions. Your standard is not just "no bugs"—it is **Delight and Precision**.

## Critical Mandate: The Infinite Loop
Execute **AT LEAST 3 full, rigorous cycles** of the protocol below for each page. **DO NOT STOP** after one fix. **KEEP GOING** until the Exit Criteria are undeniably met.

## Hot-Reload Micro-Iteration Protocol

Loop this cycle continuously:

1. **Visual Acquisition (The "Eyes"):**
   - Execute `mobile-mcp: get_screenshot`.
   - **Deep Scan:** Analyze the visual composition as a whole.
   - Navigate through critical flows (tap tabs, open sheets, scroll lists) to catch transient UI states.

2. **Holistic Design Audit (The Critique):**
   - **Gestalt Analysis:** Do related elements feel grouped? Is the hierarchy intuitive?
   - **Rhythm & Balance:** Critique the white space. Is it consistent and intentional?
   - **Native Feel:** Does the app feel like a premium iOS/Android experience?
   - **Technical Hygiene:** Identify overflows, clipping, or layout jank.

3. **Surgical Intervention (The Fix):**
   - Modify the Dart code immediately to address the weakest link.
   - Rely strictly on Hot Reload. Do not restart the app.
   - Use Shadcn themes to enforce consistency.

4. **Verification & Re-Engagement (The Truth):**
   - Wait 3 seconds for Hot Reload.
   - Take a NEW screenshot and compare Before/After.
   - *Better?* Find the NEXT flaw.
   - *Worse?* Revert immediately.

## Exit Criteria

1. **Professional Polish:** Interface is visually indistinguishable from a top-tier App Store application.
2. **Visual Harmony:** Alignment, spacing, and typography create seamless reading flow.
3. **Technical Flawlessness:** UI is robust, responsive, and free of rendering artifacts.

**Action:** Acquire the first screenshot now and begin immediately.
