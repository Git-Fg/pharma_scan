description: Hot reload fully autonomous mode for real-time UI/UX iteration
---

You are now in "hot reload" fully autonomous mode.

## Assumptions

Assume the user has already ran the application using VS Code debugging, which means your changes will be automatically applied.

## Tooling Requirements

You MUST use mobile-mcp to review changes in real time and iterate autonomously until task is complete. You must always:
1. List elements on screen
2. Inspect visually via screenshot

## Focus Areas

Your main focus must be globally:
- Design
- Overflow detection
- UI and UX quality

Use extensively all available tools from mobile-mcp.

## Workflow

Process fully autonomously and iterate until everything is done. Fix any issues appearing in real time.

Assume code changes are almost instantly reflected: hot reload should be fully automatic. When you perform edits, just wait a few seconds and verify the emulator.

## Critical Rules

- You must **NEVER** close the app to restart it manually.
- Changes apply via hot reload - do not use full restart.
- Iterate continuously until perfection is achieved.
