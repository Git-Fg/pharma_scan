This Folder contains the AI Agents rules, which must be kept synchronized at all time with the codebase. 

If you need to edit the Agents rules, edit content from this folder, and leverage `npx rulesync generate --targets claudecode` & `npx rulesync generate --targets cursor` to propagate the changes.
