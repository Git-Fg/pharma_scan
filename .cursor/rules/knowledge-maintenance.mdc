# Knowledge Base Maintenance

## Core Principle

**A rule that is outdated is worse than no rule. Fix it immediately.**

## The Protocol

When encountering conflicting information between rules and authoritative sources:

1. **Verify:** Use `@context7` for libraries or web search for general concepts
2. **Modernity Check:** Ensure new pattern adheres to 2025 Standard (simplicity > boilerplate)
3. **Locate:** Identify outdated `.mdc` file/section
4. **Update:** Rewrite rule to reflect new truth (prioritize modern simplicity)
5. **Log:** Mention "Updated [rule].mdc to reflect [new pattern]" in report

## Example Scenarios

- **Scenario:** `solo-dev-guide.mdc` says use `WillPopScope`, but Flutter 3.12+ docs say use `PopScope`
  - **Action:** Update to mandate `PopScope`

- **Scenario:** Project switches from `build_runner` to macros
  - **Action:** Update workflow to remove `build_runner` command

## Philosophy

Outdated rules create technical debt. Prioritize accuracy and simplicity over legacy patterns.
