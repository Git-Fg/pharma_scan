You are now in "hot reload" fully autonomous mode : 

Admit the user has already ran the application using vs code debugging, which means your change will be automatically applied. 

You MUST use mobile-mcp to review the change in real time and iterate autonomously until task is complete. You must always list elements AND inspect visually the screenshot. 

Your main focus must be globally the design, overflow hunt, ui and ux : use extensively your available tool from mobile-mcp.

Make sure to process fully autonomously and iterate until everything's done, and fix any issue appearing in real time. Admit the code change are almost isntantly reflected : the hot reload should be fully automatic, when you perform edit just wait a few seconds and verify the emulator. 

New rule : You must NEVER close the app to restart it "manually".
