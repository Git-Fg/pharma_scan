The following instructions require Dart 3.9 or later.\n## Overview\n[#](#overview)\nThe [Dart and Flutter MCP server](https://github.com/dart-lang/ai/tree/main/pkgs/dart_mcp_server) exposes Dart and Flutter development tool actions to compatible AI-assistant clients. MCP (model context protocol) is a protocol that enables communication between development tools and AI assistants, allowing the assistants to understand the context of the code and perform actions on behalf of the developer.\nThe Dart and Flutter MCP server can work with any MCP client that supports standard I/O (stdio) as the transport medium. To access all the features of the Dart and Flutter MCP server, an MCP client must support [Tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) and [Resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources). For the best development experience with the Dart and Flutter MCP server, an MCP client should also support [Roots](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/roots).\nIf you are using a client that claims it supports roots but doesn't actually set them, pass `--force-roots-fallback` to enable tools for managing the roots.\nThe Dart and Flutter MCP server provides a growing list of tools that grant AI assistants deep insights into your project. Here is an overview of a few things it can do:\n-   Analyze and fix errors in your project's code.\n-   Resolve symbols to elements to ensure their existence and fetch documentation and signature information for them.\n-   Introspect and interact with your running application.\n-   Search the [pub.dev site](https://pub.dev) for the best package for a use case.\n-   Manage package dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file.\n-   Run tests and analyze the results.\n-   Format code with the same formatter and config as [`dart format`](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format) and the Dart analysis server.\n## Set up your MCP client\n[#](#set-up-your-mcp-client)\nRun the server with the `dart mcp-server` command, which must be configured in your preferred client.\nThis section provides instructions for setting up the Dart and Flutter MCP server with popular tools such as Antigravity, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.\n### Antigravity\n[#](#antigravity)\nTo configure Google [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/) to use the Dart and Flutter MCP server, you can either install it from the list of available servers or [connect it as a custom MCP server](https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp#connecting-custom-mcp-servers).\n1.  Navigate to or open the **Agent** side panel.\n    If it's closed, open it by either:\n    -   Pressing Cmd/Ctrl + L.\n    -   Going to **View** \\> **Open View...** \\> **Agent**.\n2.  In the upper right of the **Agent** panel, click the **Additional options** (`...`) menu button.\n3.  Select **MCP Servers**.\n4.  In the upper right of the **Agent** panel, click **Manage MCP Servers**.\nFrom here, you can choose to install the MCP server from [the built-in MCP store](#antigravity-mcp-store-install) or by [configuring it manually](#antigravity-mcp-manual-install).\n#### Install from the MCP store\n[#](#antigravity-mcp-store-install)\n1.  In the list of available MCP servers, find or search for **Dart** and click **Install**.\n#### Connect manually\n[#](#antigravity-mcp-manual-install)\n1.  In the upper right of the **Manage MCPs** editor view, click **View raw config**.\n2.  Add the following `dart-mcp-server` entry to the `mcpServers` map:\n    mcp\\_config.json\n    json\n    ```\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"dart-mcp-server\": {\n          \"command\": \"dart\",\n          \"args\": [\n            \"mcp-server\"\n          ],\n          \"env\": {}\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    content\\_copy\n#### Install extensions\n[#](#install-extensions)\nIt is also recommended to install the Dart and Flutter extensions:\n1.  Open the **Extensions** view by either:\n    -   Pressing Shift + Cmd/Ctrl + P.\n    -   Going to **View** \\> **Extensions**.\n2.  In the **Search Extensions** input box, enter **Flutter**.\n3.  From the list of extensions, select **Flutter**.\n4.  In the **Extension: Flutter** view that opens, click the **Install** button.\n    This installs both the Dart and Flutter extensions.\nTo learn more about the Dart and Flutter extensions, check out [Develop Flutter apps in VS Code](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/vs-code).\n### Gemini CLI\n[#](#gemini-cli)\nTo configure the [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/) to use the Dart and Flutter MCP server, add a Dart entry to the `mcpServers` section of the Gemini config.\n-   To enable the server for all projects on your device, edit the `~/.gemini/settings.json` file in your home directory.\n-   To enable the server for a specific project, edit the `.gemini/settings.json` file in the project's root directory.\n.gemini/settings.json\njson\n```\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"dart\": {\n      \"command\": \"dart\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp-server\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nFor more information, check out the official Gemini CLI documentation for [setting up MCP servers](https://geminicli.com/docs/tools/mcp-server/#how-to-set-up-your-mcp-server).\n### Firebase Studio\n[#](#firebase-studio)\nIf you wish to use the Dart and Flutter MCP Server in [Firebase Studio](https://firebase.studio/), an agentic cloud-based development environment that helps you build and ship production-quality full-stack AI apps, follow these steps:\n1.  In your Firebase Studio app project, create a `.idx/mcp.json` file in your project if it doesn't exist already and add the following Dart and Flutter MCP Server configuration to the file:\n    .idx/mcp.json\n    json\n    ```\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"dart\": {\n          \"command\": \"dart\",\n          \"args\": [\n            \"mcp-server\"\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    content\\_copy\n2.  Ensure your environment is running Dart SDK 3.9/Flutter 3.35 or later.\n3.  Rebuild your workspace to complete the setup.\n    -   Open the Command Palette (**Shift+Ctrl+P**).\n    -   Enter **Firebase Studio: Rebuild Environment**.\nFor more information about MCP server configuration in Firebase Studio, check out [Connect to MCP servers](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/mcp-servers) and [Customize your Firebase Studio workspace](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/customize-workspace).\n### Gemini Code Assist in VS Code\n[#](#gemini-code-assist-in-vs-code)\n[Gemini Code Assist](https://codeassist.google/)'s [Agent mode](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/use-agentic-chat-pair-programmer) integrates the Gemini CLI to provide a powerful AI agent directly in your IDE. If you haven't set up Gemini Code Assist or its agent mode yet, follow its [Before you begin instructions](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/use-agentic-chat-pair-programmer#before-you-begin) to get started.\nTo configure Gemini Code Assist to use the Dart and Flutter MCP server, follow the instructions to [configure the Gemini CLI](#gemini-cli).\nYou can verify the MCP server has been configured properly by typing `/mcp` in the chat window in Agent mode.\nFor more information see the official Gemini Code Assist documentation for [using agent mode](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/use-agentic-chat-pair-programmer#before-you-begin).\n### GitHub Copilot in VS Code\n[#](#github-copilot-in-vs-code)\ninfoNote\nSupport for the Dart and Flutter MCP server in VS Code requires v3.116 or later of the [Dart Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.dart-code).\nBy default, the Dart extension uses the [VS Code MCP API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/mcp) to register the Dart and Flutter MCP server, as well as a tool to provide the URI for the active Dart Tooling Daemon.\nExplicitly enable or disable the Dart and Flutter MCP server by configuring the `dart.mcpServer` setting in your VS Code settings.\nTo change this globally, update your user settings:\n1.  In VS Code, click **View > Command Palette** and then search for **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)**.\n2.  Add the following setting:\n    json\n    ```\n    \"dart.mcpServer\": true\n    ```\n    content\\_copy\nIf you'd like this setting to apply only to a specific workspace, add the entry to your workspace settings:\n1.  In VS Code, click **View > Command Palette** and then search for **Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)**.\n2.  Add the following setting:\n    json\n    ```\n    \"dart.mcpServer\": true\n    ```\n    content\\_copy\nFor more information, see the official VS Code documentation for [enabling MCP support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_enable-mcp-support-in-vs-code).\n### Cursor\n[#](#cursor)\nThe easiest way to configure the Dart and Flutter MCP server with Cursor is by clicking the **Add to Cursor** button:\n[![Add to Cursor](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=dart&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoiZGFydCBtY3Atc2VydmVyIn0%3D) [![Add to Cursor](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-light.svg)](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=dart&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoiZGFydCBtY3Atc2VydmVyIn0%3D)\nAlternatively, you can configure the server manually:\n1.  Go to **Cursor > Settings > Cursor Settings > Tools & Integrations**.\n2.  Click **Add Custom MCP** or **New MCP Server** depending on whether you already have other MCP servers configured.\n3.  Edit the `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your local project (configuration will only apply to this project) or edit the global `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file in your home directory (configuration will apply for all projects) to configure the Dart and Flutter MCP server:\n    .cursor/mcp.json\n    json\n    ```\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"dart\": {\n          \"command\": \"dart\",\n          \"args\": [\n            \"mcp-server\"\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    content\\_copy\nFor more information, see the official Cursor documentation for [installing MCP servers](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#installing-mcp-servers).\n### OpenCode\n[#](#opencode)\nTo configure [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) to use the Dart and Flutter MCP server, add the `dart-mcp-server` entry to your OpenCode configuration.\nOpenCode configuration is typically found in `~/.opencode/config.json` or in your project's `opencode key` configuration.\n~/.opencode/config.json\njson\n```\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://opencode.ai/config.json\",\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"dart-mcp-server\": {\n      \"type\": \"local\",\n      \"command\": [\n        \"dart\",\n        \"mcp-server\"\n      ],\n      \"enabled\": true,\n      \"environment\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n### Claude Code\n[#](#claude-code)\nTo configure Claude Code to use the Dart and Flutter MCP server for the current project, use the `claude mcp add` CLI command:\n```\n$ claude mcp add --transport stdio dart -- dart mcp-server\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nTo learn more about configuring MCP servers in Claude Code, check out their documentation on [Installing MCP servers](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp#installing-mcp-servers).\n### Codex CLI\n[#](#codex-cli)\nTo configure the Codex CLI to use the Dart and Flutter MCP server for the current project, use the `codex mcp add` CLI command:\n```\n$ codex mcp add dart -- dart mcp-server --force-roots-fallback\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nTo learn more about configuring MCP servers in the Codex CLI, check out their documentation on [Connecting to MCP servers](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp).\n## Use your MCP client\n[#](#use-your-mcp-client)\nOnce you've set up the Dart and Flutter MCP server with a client, the Dart and Flutter MCP server enables the client to not only reason about your project's context but also to take action with tools.\nThe [Large Language Model (LLM)](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/resources/intro-llms) decides which tools to use and when, so you can focus on describing your goal in natural language. Let's see this in action with a couple of examples using GitHub Copilot's Agent mode in VS Code.\n### Fix a runtime layout error in a Flutter app\n[#](#fix-a-runtime-layout-error-in-a-flutter-app)\nWe've all been there: you build a beautiful UI, run the app, and are greeted by the infamous yellow-and-black stripes of a RenderFlex overflow error. Instead of manually debugging the widget tree, you can now ask your AI assistant for help with a prompt similar to the following:\n> Check for and fix static and runtime analysis issues. Check for and fix any layout issues.\nBehind the scenes, the AI agent uses the Dart and Flutter MCP server's tools to:\n-   See the error: It uses a tool to get the current runtime errors from the running application.\n-   Inspect the UI: It accesses the Flutter widget tree to understand the layout that is causing the overflow.\n-   Apply a fix: Armed with this context, it applies a fix and checks once more for any remaining errors.\nYou can then keep or undo the code changes.\n### Add new functionality with package search\n[#](#add-new-functionality-with-package-search)\nImagine you need to add a chart to your app. Which package should you use? How do you add it and write the boilerplate? The Dart and Flutter MCP server can streamline this entire process with a prompt similar to the following:\n> Find a suitable package to add a line chart that maps the number of button presses over time.\nThe AI agent now acts as a true assistant:\n-   Find the right tool: It uses the `pub_dev_search` tool to find popular and highly-rated charting libraries.\n-   Manage dependencies: After you confirm its choice, such as [`package:fl_chart`](https://pub.dev/packages/fl_chart), it uses a tool to add the package as a dependency.\n-   Generate the code: It generates the new widget code, complete with boilerplate for a line chart that it places in the UI. It even self-corrects syntax errors introduced during the process. You can customize further from there.\nWhat used to be a multi-step process of research, reading documentation, editing `pubspec.yaml`, and writing the appropriate code in your app, is now a single request.\nWas this page's content helpful?\nthumb\\_up thumb\\_down\nUnless stated otherwise, the documentation on this site reflects Flutter 3.38.6.
