[Tools](https://dart.dev/tools)chevron\\_right\n2.  [Static analysis](https://dart.dev/tools/analysis)\n# Customizing static analysis\nUse an analysis options file and code comments to customize static analysis.\nmore\\_vert\n-   copyCopy link\n-   [docsView source](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/blob/main/src/content/tools/analysis.md)\n-   [bug\\_reportReport issue](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/issues/new?template=1_page_issue.yml&page-url=https://dart.dev/tools/analysis&page-source=https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/blob/main/src/content/tools/analysis.md)\nStatic analysis allows you to find problems before executing a single line of code. It's a powerful tool used to prevent bugs and ensure that code conforms to style guidelines.\nWith the help of the analyzer, you can find simple typos. For example, perhaps an accidental semicolon made its way into an `if` statement:\ndart\n```\nvoid increment() {\n  if (count < 10) ;\n  count++;\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nIf properly configured, the analyzer points to the semicolon and produces the following warning:\n```\ninfo - example.dart:9:19 - Unnecessary empty statement. Try removing the empty statement or restructuring the code. - empty_statements\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nThe analyzer can also help you find more subtle problems. For example, perhaps you've forgotten to close a sink method:\ndart\n```\nvar controller = StreamController<String>();\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n```\ninfo - Unclosed instance of 'Sink'. Try invoking 'close' in the function in which the 'Sink' was created. - close_sinks\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nIn the Dart ecosystem, the Dart Analysis Server and other tools use the [analyzer package](https://pub.dev/packages/analyzer) to perform static analysis.\nYou can customize static analysis to look for a variety of potential problems, including errors and warnings specified in the [Dart language spec](https://dart.dev/resources/language/spec). You can also configure linter rules, to ensure that your code complies with the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/effective-dart/style) and other suggested guidelines in [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/effective-dart). Tools such as [`dart analyze`](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-analyze), [`flutter analyze`](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/debugging#the-dart-analyzer), and [IDEs and editors](https://dart.dev/tools#editors) use the analyzer package to evaluate your code.\nThis document explains how to customize the behavior of the analyzer using either an analysis options file or comments in Dart source code. If you want to add static analysis to your tool, see the [analyzer package](https://pub.dev/packages/analyzer) docs and the [Analysis Server API Specification.](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/pkg/analysis_server/doc/api.html)\ninfoNote\nTo view various analyzer diagnostics with explanations and common fixes, see [Diagnostic messages](https://dart.dev/tools/diagnostic-messages).\n## The analysis options file\n[#](#the-analysis-options-file)\nPlace the analysis options file, `analysis_options.yaml`, at the root of the package, in the same directory as the pubspec file.\nHere's a sample analysis options file:\nanalysis\\_options.yaml\nyaml\n```\ninclude: package:lints/recommended.yaml\n​\nanalyzer:\n  exclude: [build/**]\n  language:\n    strict-casts: true\n    strict-raw-types: true\n​\nlinter:\n  rules:\n    - cancel_subscriptions\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nThe sample illustrates the most common top-level entries:\n-   Use `include: _url_` to bring in options from the specified URL—in this case, from a file in the `lints` package. Because YAML doesn't allow duplicate keys, you can include at most one file.\n-   Use the `analyzer:` entry to customize static analysis: [enabling stricter type checks](#enabling-additional-type-checks), [excluding files](#excluding-files), [ignoring specific rules](#ignoring-rules), [changing the severity of rules](#changing-the-severity-of-rules), or [enabling experiments](https://dart.dev/tools/experiment-flags#using-experiment-flags-with-the-dart-analyzer-command-line-and-ide).\n-   Use the `linter:` entry to configure [linter rules](#enabling-linter-rules).\nwarningWarning\n**YAML is sensitive to whitespace.** Don't use tabs in a YAML file, and use 2 spaces to denote each level of indentation.\nIf the analyzer can't find an analysis options file at the package root, it walks up the directory tree, looking for one. If no file is available, the analyzer defaults to standard checks.\nConsider the following directory structure for a large project:\n![project root contains analysis_options.yaml (#1) and 3 packages, one of which (my_package) contains an analysis_options.yaml file (#2).](https://dart.dev/assets/img/guides/analysis-options-directory-structure.png)\nThe analyzer uses file #1 to analyze the code in `my_other_package` and `my_other_other_package`, and file #2 to analyze the code in `my_package`.\n## Enabling stricter type checks\n[#](#enabling-additional-type-checks)\nIf you want stricter static checks than the [Dart type system](https://dart.dev/language/type-system) requires, consider enabling the `strict-casts`, `strict-inference`, and `strict-raw-types` language modes:\nanalysis\\_options.yaml\nyaml\n```\nanalyzer:\n  language:\n    strict-casts: true\n    strict-inference: true\n    strict-raw-types: true\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nYou can use the modes together or separately; all default to `false`.\n`strict-casts: <bool>`\nA value of `true` ensures that the type inference engine never implicitly casts from `dynamic` to a more specific type. The following valid Dart code includes an implicit downcast from the `dynamic` value returned by `jsonDecode` to `List<String>` that could fail at runtime. This mode reports the potential error, requiring you to add an explicit cast or otherwise adjust your code.\nstatic analysis: failure dart\n```\nvoid foo(List<String> lines) {\n  ...\n}\n​\nvoid bar(String jsonText) {\n  foo(jsonDecode(jsonText)); // Implicit cast\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n```\nerror - The argument type 'dynamic' can't be assigned to the parameter type 'List<String>'. - argument_type_not_assignable\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nmerge\\_type Version note\nThe `strict-casts` mode was introduced in Dart 2.16. To enable similar checks with earlier SDK releases, consider using the now deprecated `implicit-casts` option:\nyaml\n```\nanalyzer:\n  strong-mode:\n    implicit-casts: false\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n`strict-inference: <bool>`\nA value of `true` ensures that the type inference engine never chooses the `dynamic` type when it can't determine a static type. The following valid Dart code creates a `Map` whose type argument cannot be inferred, resulting in an inference failure hint by this mode:\nstatic analysis: failure dart\n```\nfinal lines = {}; // Inference failure\nlines['Dart'] = 10000;\nlines['C++'] = 'one thousand';\nlines['Go'] = 2000;\nprint('Lines: ${lines.values.reduce((a, b) => a + b)}'); // Runtime error\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n```\nwarning - The type argument(s) of 'Map' can't be inferred - inference_failure_on_collection_literal\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nlightbulbTip\nThe `strict-inference` mode can identify many situations which result in an inference failure.\nSee [Conditions for strict inference failure](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/main/resources/type-system/strict-inference.md#conditions-for-strict-inference-failure) for an exhaustive list of inference failure conditions.\n`strict-raw-types: <bool>`\nA value of `true` ensures that the type inference engine never chooses the `dynamic` type when it can't determine a static type due to omitted type arguments. The following valid Dart code has a `List` variable with a raw type, resulting in a raw type hint by this mode:\nstatic analysis: failure dart\n```\nList numbers = [1, 2, 3]; // List with raw type\nfor (final n in numbers) {\n  print(n.length); // Runtime error\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n```\nwarning - The generic type 'List<dynamic>' should have explicit type arguments but doesn't - strict_raw_type\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n## Enabling and disabling linter rules\n[#](#enabling-linter-rules)\nThe analyzer package also provides a code linter. A wide variety of [linter rules](https://dart.dev/tools/linter-rules) are available. Linters tend to be nondenominational—rules don't have to agree with each other. For example, some rules are more appropriate for regular Dart packages and others are designed for Flutter apps. Note that linter rules can have false positives, unlike static analysis.\n### Enabling Dart team recommended linter rules\n[#](#lints)\nThe Dart team provides two sets of recommended linter rules in the [lints package](https://pub.dev/packages/lints):\nCore rules\nHelp identify critical issues that are likely to lead to problems when running or consuming Dart code. All code should pass these linter rules. Packages that are uploaded to [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) have a [package score](https://pub.dev/help/scoring) that's based in part on passing these rules.\nRecommended rules\nHelp identify additional issues that may lead to problems when running or consuming Dart code, and enforce a single, idiomatic style and format. We recommend that all Dart code use these rules, which are a superset of the core rules.\nlightbulbTip\nIf you're working on Flutter code, then instead of using the `lints` package, use [`flutter_lints`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints), which provides a superset of the recommended rules.\nTo enable either set of lints, add the [lints package](https://pub.dev/packages/lints) as a dev dependency:\n```\n$ dart pub add --dev lints\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nThen edit your `analysis_options.yaml` file to include your preferred rule set:\nyaml\n```\ninclude: package:lints/<RULE_SET>.yaml\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nFor example, you can include the recommended rule set like this:\nyaml\n```\ninclude: package:lints/recommended.yaml\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nfeedback Important\nWhen a **new version of `lints`** is published, code that previously passed analysis might **start failing analysis.** We recommend updating your code to work with the new rules. Other options are to explicitly enable individual linter rules or [disable individual rules](#disabling-individual-rules).\ninfoNote\nFor more information about including options files, check out the [Including shared options](#including-shared-options) section.\n### Enabling individual rules\n[#](#individual-rules)\nTo enable a single linter rule, add `linter:` to the analysis options file as a top-level key, followed by `rules:` as a second-level key. On subsequent lines, specify the rules that you want to apply, prefixed with dashes (the syntax for a YAML list). For example:\nyaml\n```\nlinter:\n  rules:\n    - always_declare_return_types\n    - annotate_redeclares\n    - cancel_subscriptions\n    - close_sinks\n    - combinators_ordering\n    - comment_references\n    - invalid_case_patterns\n    - one_member_abstracts\n    - only_throw_errors\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n### Disabling individual rules\n[#](#disabling-individual-rules)\nIf you include an analysis options file such as the one in `lints`, you might want to disable some of the included rules. Disabling individual rules is similar to enabling them, but requires the use of a map rather than a list as the value for the `rules:` entry, so each line should contain the name of a rule followed by either `: false` or `: true`.\nHere's an example of an analysis options file that uses all the recommended rules from `lints` except `avoid_shadowing_type_parameters`. It also enables the lint `await_only_futures`:\nanalysis\\_options.yaml\nyaml\n```\ninclude: package:lints/recommended.yaml\n​\nlinter:\n  rules:\n    avoid_shadowing_type_parameters: false\n    await_only_futures: true\n```\ncontent\\_copy\ninfoNote\nDue to YAML restrictions, **you can't mix list and key-value syntax in the same `rules` entry.** You can use the other syntax for rules in an included file.\n## Including shared options\n[#](#including-shared-options)\nAn analysis options file can include options which are specified in another options file, or even a list of other options files. You can specify such files using the top-level `include:` field:\nanalysis\\_options.yaml\nyaml\n```\ninclude: package:flutter_lints/recommended.yaml\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nAn included options file can be specified with a `package:` path, or a relative path. Multiple analysis options files can be specified in a list:\nanalysis\\_options.yaml\nyaml\n```\ninclude:\n  - package:flutter_lints/recommended.yaml\n  - ../team_options.yaml\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nOptions in an included file can be overridden in the including file, as well as by subsequent included files. In other words, the options specified by an analysis options file are computed by first applying the options specified in each of the included files (by recursively applying this algorithm), in the order they appear in the list, and then overriding them with any locally defined options.\nFor example, given the following options files:\nthree.yaml\nyaml\n```\ninclude: two.yaml\n# ...\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nAnd a final options file that includes these:\nanalysis\\_options.yaml\nyaml\n```\ninclude:\n  - one.yaml\n  - three.yaml\n# ...\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nThen the combined analysis options are computed by applying the options found in `one.yaml`, then `two.yaml`, then `three.yaml`, and finally `analysis_options.yaml`.\n## Enabling analyzer plugins (experimental)\n[#](#plugins)\ninfoNote\nThis is for the legacy plugin system, which will be deprecated in a future release. For new development use the new [analyzer plugin](https://dart.dev/tools/analyzer-plugins) system.\nThe analyzer has experimental support for legacy plugins. These plugins integrate with the analyzer to add functionality such as new diagnostics, quick fixes, and custom code completion. You can enable only one plugin per `analysis_options.yaml` file. Enabling a legacy analyzer plugin increases how much memory the analyzer uses.\nDon't use legacy analyzer plugins if your situation meets either of the following conditions:\n-   You use a development machine with less than 16 GB of memory.\n-   You use a mono-repo with more than 10 `pubspec.yaml` and `analysis_options.yaml` files.\nYou can find a few legacy analyzer plugins on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages?q=dependency%3Aanalyzer_plugin).\nTo enable a legacy plugin:\n1.  Add the package containing the plugin as a dev dependency.\n    ```\n    $ dart pub add --dev <your_favorite_analyzer_plugin_package>\n    ```\n    content\\_copy\n2.  Edit your `analysis_options.yaml` file to enable the plugin.\n    yaml\n    ```\n    analyzer:\n      plugins:\n        - your_favorite_analyzer_plugin_package\n    ```\n    content\\_copy\n    To indicate specific plugin functionality to enable, such as new diagnostics, additional setup might be required.\n## Excluding code from analysis\n[#](#excluding-code-from-analysis)\nSometimes it's OK for some code to fail analysis. For example, you might rely on code generated by a package that you don't own—the generated code works, but produces warnings during static analysis. Or a linter rule might cause a false positive that you want to suppress.\nYou have a few ways to exclude code from analysis:\n-   Exclude entire files from analysis.\n-   Stop specific non-error rules from being applied to individual files.\n-   Stop specific non-error rules from being applied to individual lines of code.\nYou can also [disable specific rules](#disabling-individual-rules) for all files or [change the severity of rules](#changing-the-severity-of-rules).\n### Excluding files\n[#](#excluding-files)\nTo exclude files from static analysis, use the `exclude:` analyzer option. You can list individual files, or use [glob](https://pub.dev/packages/glob) pattern syntax. All usages of glob patterns should be relative to the directory containing the `analysis_options.yaml` file.\nyaml\n```\nanalyzer:\n  exclude:\n    - lib/client.dart\n    - lib/server/*.g.dart\n    - test/_data/**\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n### Suppressing diagnostics for a file\n[#](#suppressing-diagnostics-for-a-file)\nTo ignore a specific non-error diagnostic for a specific file, add an `ignore_for_file` comment to the file:\ndart\n```\n// ignore_for_file: unused_local_variable\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nThis acts for the whole file, before or after the comment, and is particularly useful for generated code.\nTo suppress more than one diagnostic, use a comma-separated list:\ndart\n```\n// ignore_for_file: unused_local_variable, duplicate_ignore, dead_code\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nTo suppress all linter rules, add a `type=lint` specifier:\ndart\n```\n// ignore_for_file: type=lint\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nmerge\\_type Version note\nSupport for the `type=lint` specifier was added in Dart 2.15.\n### Suppressing diagnostics for a line of code\n[#](#suppressing-diagnostics-for-a-line-of-code)\nTo suppress a specific non-error diagnostic on a specific line of Dart code, put an `ignore` comment above the line of code. Here's an example of ignoring code that causes a runtime error, as you might do in a language test:\ndart\n```\n// ignore: invalid_assignment\nint x = '';\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nTo suppress more than one diagnostic, supply a comma-separated list:\ndart\n```\n// ignore: invalid_assignment, const_initialized_with_non_constant_value\nconst x = y;\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nAlternatively, append the ignore comment to the line that it applies to:\ndart\n```\nint x = ''; // ignore: invalid_assignment\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n### Suppressing diagnostics in a pubspec file\n[#](#suppressing-diagnostics-in-a-pubspec-file)\nIf you need to suppress a non-error diagnostic from the analyzer in a `pubspec.yaml` file, add an `ignore` comment above the affected line.\nThe following example ignores the [`sort_pub_dependencies`](https://dart.dev/tools/linter-rules/sort_pub_dependencies) lint as it wants to put the `flutter` dependency first:\npubspec.yaml\nyaml\n```\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n​\n  # ignore: sort_pub_dependencies\n  collection: ^1.19.0\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nmerge\\_type Version note\nSupport for ignore comments in `pubspec.yaml` files was added in Dart 3.3. If you are using Dart 3.2 or earlier, the ignored diagnostic will still be triggered.\n## Customizing analysis rules\n[#](#customizing-analysis-rules)\nEach [analyzer diagnostic](https://dart.dev/tools/diagnostic-messages) and [linter rule](https://dart.dev/tools/linter-rules) has a default severity. You can use the analysis options file to change the severity of individual rules, or to always ignore some rules.\nThe analyzer supports three severity levels:\n`info`\nAn informational message that doesn't cause analysis to fail. Example: [`dead_code`](https://dart.dev/tools/diagnostic-messages#dead_code)\n`warning`\nA warning that doesn't cause analysis to fail unless the analyzer is configured to treat warnings as errors. Example: [`invalid_null_aware_operator`](https://dart.dev/tools/diagnostic-messages#invalid_null_aware_operator)\n`error`\nAn error that causes analysis to fail. Example: [`invalid_assignment`](https://dart.dev/tools/diagnostic-messages#invalid_assignment)\n### Ignoring rules\n[#](#ignoring-rules)\nYou can ignore specific [analyzer diagnostics](https://dart.dev/tools/diagnostic-messages) and [linter rules](https://dart.dev/tools/linter-rules) by using the `errors:` field. List the rule, followed by `: ignore`. For example, the following analysis options file instructs the analysis tools to ignore the TODO rule:\nyaml\n```\nanalyzer:\n  errors:\n    todo: ignore\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n### Changing the severity of rules\n[#](#changing-the-severity-of-rules)\nYou can globally change the severity of a particular rule. This technique works for regular analysis issues as well as for lints. For example, the following analysis options file instructs the analysis tools to treat invalid assignments as warnings and missing returns as errors, and to provide information (but not a warning or error) about dead code:\nyaml\n```\nanalyzer:\n  errors:\n    invalid_assignment: warning\n    missing_return: error\n    dead_code: info\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n## Configuring `dart format`\n[#](#configuring-dart-format)\nYou can configure the behavior of [`dart format`](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format) by adding a `formatter` section to the analysis options file specifying your preferred `page_width`.\nFor more information, read [Configuring formatter page width](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format#configuring-formatter-page-width).\n## Resources\n[#](#resources)\nUse the following resources to learn more about static analysis in Dart:\n-   [Dart's type system](https://dart.dev/language/type-system)\n-   [Dart linter rules](https://dart.dev/tools/linter-rules)\n-   [analyzer package](https://pub.dev/packages/analyzer)\n-   [Troubleshoot analyzer performance](https://dart.dev/tools/analyzer-performance)\nWas this page's content helpful?\nthumb\\_up thumb\\_down\nUnless stated otherwise, the documentation on this site reflects Dart 3.10.3.
