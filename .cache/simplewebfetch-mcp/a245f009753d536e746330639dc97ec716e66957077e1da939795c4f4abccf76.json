  "markdown": "# Overview | Patrol\nNative automation\nFlutter's [integration\\_test](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/master/packages/integration_test) does a good job at providing basic support for integration testing Flutter apps. What it can't do is interaction with the OS your Flutter app is running on. This makes it impossible to test many critical business features:\n-   granting runtime permissions\n-   signing into the app which uses WebView or OAuth (like Google) as the login page\n-   listing and tapping on notifications\n-   exiting the app, coming back, and verifying that state is preserved\n-   enabling and disabling features such as Wi-Fi, mobile data, location, or dark mode\nPatrol's _platform automation_ feature finally solves these problems. Here's a tiny snippet to spice things up:\n```\nvoid main() {\n  patrolTest('demo', (PatrolIntegrationTester $) async {\n    await $.pumpWidgetAndSettle(AwesomeApp());\n    // prepare network conditions\n    await $.platform.mobile.enableCellular();\n    await $.platform.mobile.disableWifi();\n    // toggle system theme\n    await $.platform.mobile.enableDarkMode();\n    // handle native location permission request dialog\n    await $.platform.mobile.selectFineLocation();\n    await $.platform.mobile.grantPermissionWhenInUse();\n    // tap on the first notification\n    await $.platform.mobile.openNotifications();\n    await $.platform.mobile.tapOnNotificationByIndex(0);\n  });\n}\n```\nFor web applications, Patrol provides browser-specific automation capabilities. You can interact with browser dialogs, manage cookies, handle file uploads, and more:\n```\nvoid main() {\n  patrolTest('web demo', (PatrolIntegrationTester $) async {\n    await $.pumpWidgetAndSettle(AwesomeWebApp());\n    // grant browser permissions\n    await $.platform.web.grantPermissions(permissions: ['clipboard-read']);\n    // manage cookies\n    await $.platform.web.addCookie(name: 'session', value: 'abc123');\n    // handle browser dialogs\n    await $.platform.web.acceptNextDialog();\n  });\n}\n```\nPlatform automation is currently available on Android, iOS, and Web.",
