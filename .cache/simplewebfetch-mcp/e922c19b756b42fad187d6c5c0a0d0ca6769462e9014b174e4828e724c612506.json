If a signal is not read, it will not be computed\n-   🗜️ **Flexible API**: Every app is different and signals can be composed in multiple ways. There are a few rules to follow but the API surface is small\n-   🔬 **Surgical Rendering**: Widgets can be rebuilt surgically, only marking dirty the parts of the Widget tree that need to be updated and if mounted\n-   💙 **100% Dart Native**: Supports Dart JS (HTML), Shelf Server, CLI (and Native), VM, Flutter (Web, Mobile and Desktop). Signals can be used in any Dart project\nTo start using signals, check out the full [documentation](https://dartsignals.dev/).\n## Other packages\n| Package | Pub |\n| --- | --- |\n| `signals` | [![signals](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/signals.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/signals) |\n| `signals_core` | [![signals_core](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/signals_core.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/signals_core) |\n| `signals_hooks` | [![signals_hooks](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/signals_hooks.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/signals_hooks) |\n| `signals_lint` | [![signals_lint](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/signals_lint.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/signals_lint) |\n## Libraries\n[extended](https://pub.dev/documentation/signals_flutter/flutter_extensions/)\n[signals\\_core](https://pub.dev/documentation/signals_flutter/signals_core/)\n[signals\\_core\\_extended](https://pub.dev/documentation/signals_flutter/signals_core_extended/)\n[signals\\_flutter](https://pub.dev/documentation/signals_flutter/signals_flutter/)\n1.
