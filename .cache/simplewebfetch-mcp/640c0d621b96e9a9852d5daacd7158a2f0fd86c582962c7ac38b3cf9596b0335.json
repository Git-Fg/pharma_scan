They are a major component of [static JS interop](https://dart.dev/go/next-gen-js-interop) because they can easily modify an existing type's interface (crucial for any kind of interop) without incurring the cost of an actual wrapper.\nExtension types enforce discipline on the set of operations (or interface) available to objects of an underlying type, called the _representation type_. When defining the interface of an extension type, you can choose to reuse some members of the representation type, omit others, replace others, and add new functionality.\nThe following example wraps the `int` type to create an extension type that only allows operations that make sense for ID numbers:\ndart\n```\nextension type IdNumber(int id) {\n  // Wraps the 'int' type's '<' operator:\n  operator <(IdNumber other) => id < other.id;\n  // Doesn't declare the '+' operator, for example,\n  // because addition does not make sense for ID numbers.\n}\n​\nvoid main() {\n  // Without the discipline of an extension type,\n  // 'int' exposes ID numbers to unsafe operations:\n  int myUnsafeId = 42424242;\n  myUnsafeId = myUnsafeId + 10; // This works, but shouldn't be allowed for IDs.\n​\n  var safeId = IdNumber(42424242);\n  safeId + 10; // Compile-time error: No '+' operator.\n  myUnsafeId = safeId; // Compile-time error: Wrong type.\n  myUnsafeId = safeId as int; // OK: Run-time cast to representation type.\n  safeId < IdNumber(42424241); // OK: Uses wrapped '<' operator.\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\ninfoNote\nExtension types serve the same purpose as **wrapper classes**, but don't require the creation of an extra run-time object, which can get expensive when you need to wrap lots of objects. Because extension types are static-only and compiled away at run time, they are essentially zero cost.\n[**Extension methods**](https://dart.dev/language/extension-methods) (also known just as \"extensions\") are a static abstraction similar to extension types. However, an extension method adds functionality _directly_ to every instance of its underlying type. Extension types are different; an extension type's interface _only_ applies to expressions whose static type is that extension type. They are distinct from the interface of their underlying type by default.\n## Syntax\n[#](#syntax)\n### Declaration\n[#](#declaration)\nDefine a new extension type with the `extension type` declaration and a name, followed by the _representation type declaration_ in parentheses:\ndart\n```\nextension type E(int i) {\n  // Define set of operations.\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nThe representation type declaration `(int i)` specifies that the underlying type of extension type `E` is `int`, and that the reference to the _representation object_ is named `i`. The declaration also introduces:\n-   An implicit getter for the representation object with the representation type as the return type: `int get i`.\n-   An implicit constructor: `E(int i) : i = i`.\nThe representation getter gives access to the representation object typed as the underlying type. The getter is in scope in the extension type body, and you can access it using its name like any other getter:\n-   Within the extension type body using `i` (or `this.i`).\n-   Outside with a property extraction using `e.i` (where `e` has the extension type as its static type).\nExtension type declarations can also include [type parameters](https://dart.dev/language/generics) just like classes or extensions:\ndart\n```\nextension type E<T>(List<T> elements) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n### Constructors\n[#](#constructors)\nYou can optionally declare [constructors](https://dart.dev/language/constructors) in an extension type's body. The representation declaration itself is an implicit constructor, so by default takes the place of an unnamed constructor for the extension type. Any additional non-redirecting generative constructors must initialize the representation object's instance variable using `this.i` in its initializer list or formal parameters.\ndart\n```\nextension type E(int i) {\n  E.n(this.i);\n  E.m(int j, String foo) : i = j + foo.length;\n}\n​\nvoid main() {\n  E(4); // Implicit unnamed constructor.\n  E.n(3); // Named constructor.\n  E.m(5, \"Hello!\"); // Named constructor with additional parameters.\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nOr, you can name the representation declaration constructor, in which case there is room for an unnamed constructor in the body:\ndart\n```\nextension type const E._(int it) {\n  E(): this._(42);\n  E.otherName(this.it);\n}\n​\nvoid main2() {\n  E();\n  const E._(2);\n  E.otherName(3);\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nYou can also completely hide the constructor, instead of just defining a new one, using the same private constructor syntax for classes, `_`. For example, if you only want clients constructing `E` with a `String`, even though the underlying type is `int`:\ndart\n```\nextension type E._(int i) {\n  E.fromString(String foo) : i = int.parse(foo);\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nYou can also declare forwarding generative constructors, or [factory constructors](https://dart.dev/language/constructors#factory-constructors) (which can also forward to constructors of sub-extension types).\n### Members\n[#](#members)\nDeclare members in the body of an extension type to define its interface the same way you would for class members. Extension type members can be methods, getters, setters, or operators (non-[`external`](https://dart.dev/language/functions#external) [instance variables](https://dart.dev/language/classes#instance-variables) and [abstract members](https://dart.dev/language/methods#abstract-methods) are not allowed):\ndart\n```\nextension type NumberE(int value) {\n  // Operator:\n  NumberE operator +(NumberE other) =>\n      NumberE(value + other.value);\n  // Getter:\n  NumberE get myNum => this;\n  // Method:\n  bool isValid() => !value.isNegative;\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nInterface members of the representation type are not interface members of the extension type [by default](#transparency). To make a single member of the representation type available on the extension type, you must write a declaration for it in the extension type definition, like the `operator +` in `NumberE`. You also can define new members unrelated to the representation type, like the `i` getter and `isValid` method.\n### Implements\n[#](#implements)\nYou can optionally use the `implements` clause to:\n-   Introduce a subtype relationship on an extension type, AND\n-   Add the members of the representation object to the extension type interface.\nThe `implements` clause introduces an [applicability](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/main/accepted/2.7/static-extension-methods/feature-specification.md#examples) relationship like the one between an [extension method](https://dart.dev/language/extension-methods) and its `on` type. Members that are applicable to the supertype are applicable to the subtype as well, unless the subtype has a declaration with the same member name.\nAn extension type can only implement:\n-   **Its representation type**. This makes all members of the representation type implicitly available to the extension type.\n    dart\n    ```\n    extension type NumberI(int i)\n      implements int{\n      // 'NumberI' can invoke all members of 'int',\n      // plus anything else it declares here.\n    }\n    ```\n    content\\_copy\n-   **A supertype of its representation type**. This makes the members of the supertype available, while not necessarily all the members of representation type.\n    dart\n    ```\n    extension type Sequence<T>(List<T> _) implements Iterable<T> {\n      // Better operations than List.\n    }\n    ​\n    extension type Id(int _id) implements Object {\n      // Makes the extension type non-nullable.\n      static Id? tryParse(String source) => int.tryParse(source) as Id?;\n    }\n    ```\n    content\\_copy\n-   **Another extension type** that is valid on the same representation type. This allows you to reuse operations across multiple extension types (similar to multiple inheritance).\n    dart\n    ```\n    extension type const Opt<T>._(({T value})? _) {\n      const factory Opt(T value) = Val<T>;\n      const factory Opt.none() = Non<T>;\n    }\n    extension type const Val<T>._(({T value}) _) implements Opt<T> {\n      const Val(T value) : this._((value: value));\n      T get value => _.value;\n    }\n    extension type const Non<T>._(Null _) implements Opt<Never> {\n      const Non() : this._(null);\n    }\n    ```\n    content\\_copy\nRead the [Usage](#usage) section to learn more about the effect of `implements` in different scenarios.\n#### `@redeclare`\n[#](#redeclare)\nDeclaring an extension type member that shares a name with a member of a supertype is _not_ an override relationship like it is between classes, but rather a _redeclaration_. An extension type member declaration _completely replaces_ any supertype member with the same name. It's not possible to provide an alternative implementation for the same function.\nYou can use the [`@redeclare`](https://pub.dev/documentation/meta/latest/meta/redeclare-constant.html) annotation from `package:meta` to tell the compiler you are _knowingly_ choosing to use the same name as a supertype's member. The analyzer will then warn you if that's not actually true, for example, if one of the names is mistyped.\ndart\n```\nimport 'package:meta/meta.dart';\n​\nextension type MyString(String _) implements String {\n  // Replaces 'String.operator[]'.\n  @redeclare\n  int operator [](int index) => codeUnitAt(index);\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nYou can also enable the lint [`annotate_redeclares`](https://dart.dev/tools/linter-rules/annotate_redeclares) to get a warning if you declare an extension type method that hides a superinterface member and _isn't_ annotated with `@redeclare`.\n## Usage\n[#](#usage)\nTo use an extension type, create an instance the same as you would with a class: by calling a constructor:\ndart\n```\nextension type NumberE(int value) {\n  NumberE operator +(NumberE other) =>\n      NumberE(value + other.value);\n​\n  NumberE get next => NumberE(value + 1);\n  bool isValid() => !value.isNegative;\n}\n​\nvoid testE() {\n  var num = NumberE(1);\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nThen, you can invoke members on the object as you would with a class object.\nThere are two equally valid, but substantially different core use cases for extension types:\n1.  Providing an _extended_ interface to an existing type.\n2.  Providing a _different_ interface to an existing type.\ninfoNote\nIn any case, the representation type of an extension type is never its subtype, so a representation type can't be used interchangeably where the extension type is needed.\n### 1\\. Provide an _extended_ interface to an existing type\n[#](#provide-extended-interface)\nWhen an extension type [implements](#implements) its representation type, you can consider it \"transparent\", because it allows the extension type to \"see\" the underlying type.\nA transparent extension type can invoke all members of the representation type (that aren't [redeclared](#redeclare)), plus any auxiliary members it defines. This creates a new, _extended_ interface for an existing type. The new interface is available to expressions whose static type is the extension type.\nThis means you _can_ invoke members of the representation type (unlike a [non-transparent](#provide-different-interface) extension type), like so:\ndart\n```\nextension type NumberT(int value)\n  implements int {\n  // Doesn't explicitly declare any members of 'int'.\n  NumberT get i => this;\n}\n​\nvoid main () {\n  // All OK: Transparency allows invoking `int` members on the extension type:\n  var v1 = NumberT(1); // v1 type: NumberT\n  int v2 = NumberT(2); // v2 type: int\n  var v3 = v1.i - v1;  // v3 type: int\n  var v4 = v2 + v1; // v4 type: int\n  var v5 = 2 + v1; // v5 type: int\n  // Error: Extension type interface is not available to representation type\n  v2.i;\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nYou can also have a \"mostly-transparent\" extension type that adds new members and adapts others by redeclaring a given member name from the supertype. This would allow you to use stricter types on some parameters of a method, or different default values, for example.\nAnother mostly-transparent extension type approach is to implement a type that is a supertype of the representation type. For example, if the representation type is private but its supertype defines the part of the interface that matters for clients.\n### 2\\. Provide a _different_ interface to an existing type\n[#](#provide-different-interface)\nAn extension type that is not [transparent](#transparency) (that does not [`implement`](#implements) its representation type) is statically treated as a completely new type, distinct from its representation type. You can't assign it to its representation type, and it doesn't expose its representation type's members.\nFor example, take the `NumberE` extension type we declared under [Usage](#usage):\ndart\n```\nvoid testE() {\n  var num1 = NumberE(1);\n  int num2 = NumberE(2); // Error: Can't assign 'NumberE' to 'int'.\n​\n  num1.isValid(); // OK: Extension member invocation.\n  num1.isNegative(); // Error: 'NumberE' does not define 'int' member 'isNegative'.\n​\n  var sum1 = num1 + num1; // OK: 'NumberE' defines '+'.\n  var diff1 = num1 - num1; // Error: 'NumberE' does not define 'int' member '-'.\n  var diff2 = num1.value - 2; // OK: Can access representation object with reference.\n  var sum2 = num1 + 2; // Error: Can't assign 'int' to parameter type 'NumberE'.\n​\n  List<NumberE> numbers = [\n    NumberE(1),\n    num1.next, // OK: 'next' getter returns type 'NumberE'.\n    1, // Error: Can't assign 'int' element to list type 'NumberE'.\n  ];\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nYou can use an extension type this way to _replace_ the interface of an existing type. This allows you to model an interface that is makes sense for the constraints of your new type (like the `IdNumber` example in the introduction), while also benefitting from the performance and convenience of a simple pre-defined type, like `int`.\nThis use case is as close as you can get to the complete encapsulation of a wrapper class (but is realistically only a [_somewhat_ protected](#type-considerations) abstraction).\n## Type considerations\n[#](#type-considerations)\nExtension types are a compile-time wrapping construct. At run time, there is absolutely no trace of the extension type. Any type query or similar run-time operations work on the representation type.\nThis makes extension types an _unsafe_ abstraction, because you can always find out the representation type at run time and access the underlying object.\nDynamic type tests (`e is T`), casts (`e as T`), and other run-time type queries (like `switch (e) ...` or `if (e case ...)`) all evaluate to the underlying representation object, and type check against that object's runtime type. That's true when the static type of `e` is an extension type, and when testing against an extension type (`case MyExtensionType(): ...` ).\ndart\n```\nvoid main() {\n  var n = NumberE(1);\n​\n  // The run-time type of 'n' is the representation type 'int'.\n  if (n is int) print(n); // Prints 1.\n​\n  // Can use 'int' methods on 'n' at run time.\n  if (n case int x) print(x.toRadixString(10)); // Prints 1.\n  switch (n) {\n    case int(:var isEven): print(\"$n (${isEven ? \"even\" : \"odd\"})\"); // Prints 1 (odd).\n  }\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nSimilarly, the static type of the matched value is that of the extension type in this example:\ndart\n```\nvoid main() {\n  int i = 2;\n  if (i is NumberE) print(\"It is\"); // Prints 'It is'.\n  if (i case NumberE v) print(\"value: ${v.value}\"); // Prints 'value: 2'.\n  switch (i) {\n    case NumberE(:var value): print(\"value: $value\"); // Prints 'value: 2'.\n  }\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nWhen `i` gets the static type `NumberE` based on a cast or a pattern match, `i` still refers to the same object, and `v` refers to the same object as `i`, and the object itself remains unchanged. It is only the static type that changed (and hence the methods that we can call on this object). In particular, the change of type does not involve an invocation of a constructor. If you wish to execute a constructor (for example, to perform some kind of validation) then it is necessary to write an explicit constructor invocation (such as `NumberE(i)`).\nIt's important to be aware of this behavior when using extension types. Always keep in mind that an extension type exists and matters at compile time, but gets _erased_ during compilation.\nFor example, consider an expression `e` whose static type is the extension type `E`. Assume that the representation type of `E` is `R`. The run-time type of the value of `e` is then a subtype of `R`. Even the type itself is erased; `List<E>` is exactly the same thing as `List<R>` at run time.\nIn other words, a real wrapper class can encapsulate a wrapped object, whereas an extension type is just a compile-time view on the wrapped object. While a real wrapper is safer, the trade-off is extension types give you the option to avoid wrapper objects, which can greatly improve performance in some scenarios.\n[chevron\\_left\nPrevious Extension methods\n](https://dart.dev/language/extension-methods)[\nNext Callable objects\nchevron\\_right](https://dart.dev/language/callable-objects)\nWas this page's content helpful?\nthumb\\_up thumb\\_down\nUnless stated otherwise, the documentation on this site reflects Dart 3.10.3.
