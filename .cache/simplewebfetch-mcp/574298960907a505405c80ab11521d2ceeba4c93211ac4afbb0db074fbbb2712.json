If a signal is not read, it will not be computed\n-   🗜️ **Flexible API**: Every app is different and signals can be composed in multiple ways. There are a few rules to follow but the API surface is small\n-   🔬 **Surgical Rendering**: Widgets can be rebuilt surgically, only marking dirty the parts of the Widget tree that need to be updated and if mounted\n-   💙 **100% Dart Native**: Supports Dart JS (HTML), Shelf Server, CLI (and Native), VM, Flutter (Web, Mobile and Desktop). Signals can be used in any Dart project\nTo start using signals, check out the full [documentation](https://dartsignals.dev/).\n## Other packages [#](#other-packages)\n| Package | Pub |\n| --- | --- |\n| `signals` | [![signals](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/signals.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/signals) |\n| `signals_core` | [![signals_core](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/signals_core.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/signals_core) |\n| `signals_hooks` | [![signals_hooks](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/signals_hooks.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/signals_hooks) |\n| `signals_lint` | [![signals_lint](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/signals_lint.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/signals_lint) |\n[\n62\nlikes\n150\npoints\n10.8k\ndownloads\n](https://pub.dev/packages/signals_flutter/score)\n### Publisher\n[![verified publisher](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/material-icon-verified.svg \"Published by a pub.dev verified publisher\")rodydavis.com](https://pub.dev/publishers/rodydavis.com)\n### Weekly Downloads\n### Metadata\nThe signals library exposes four core functions which are the building blocks to model any business logic you can think of.\n[Homepage](https://dartsignals.dev/)\n[Repository (GitHub)](https://github.com/rodydavis/signals.dart)\n[View/report issues](https://github.com/rodydavis/signals.dart/issues)\n### Topics\n[#signal](https://pub.dev/packages?q=topic%3Asignal) [#reactive](https://pub.dev/packages?q=topic%3Areactive) [#state](https://pub.dev/packages?q=topic%3Astate) [#signals](https://pub.dev/packages?q=topic%3Asignals) [#rx](https://pub.dev/packages?q=topic%3Arx)\n### Documentation\n[Documentation](https://dartsignals.dev/)\n[API reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/signals_flutter/latest/)\n### License\n![](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/material-icon-balance.svg)Apache-2.0 ([license](https://pub.dev/packages/signals_flutter/license))\n### Dependencies\n[flutter](https://api.flutter.dev/), [signals\\_core](https://pub.dev/packages/signals_core \"^6.2.1\")\n### More\n[Packages that depend on signals\\_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages?q=dependency%3Asignals_flutter)\n### ← Metadata\n[\n62\nlikes\n150\npoints\n10.8k\ndownloads\n](https://pub.dev/packages/signals_flutter/score)\n### Publisher\n[![verified publisher](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/material-icon-verified.svg \"Published by a pub.dev verified publisher\")rodydavis.com](https://pub.dev/publishers/rodydavis.com)\n### Weekly Downloads\n### Metadata\nThe signals library exposes four core functions which are the building blocks to model any business logic you can think of.\n[Homepage](https://dartsignals.dev/)\n[Repository (GitHub)](https://github.com/rodydavis/signals.dart)\n[View/report issues](https://github.com/rodydavis/signals.dart/issues)\n### Topics\n[#signal](https://pub.dev/packages?q=topic%3Asignal) [#reactive](https://pub.dev/packages?q=topic%3Areactive) [#state](https://pub.dev/packages?q=topic%3Astate) [#signals](https://pub.dev/packages?q=topic%3Asignals) [#rx](https://pub.dev/packages?q=topic%3Arx)\n### Documentation\n[Documentation](https://dartsignals.dev/)\n[API reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/signals_flutter/latest/)\n### License\n![](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/material-icon-balance.svg)Apache-2.0 ([license](https://pub.dev/packages/signals_flutter/license))\n### Dependencies\n[flutter](https://api.flutter.dev/), [signals\\_core](https://pub.dev/packages/signals_core \"^6.2.1\")\n### More\n[Packages that depend on signals\\_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages?q=dependency%3Asignals_flutter)\nBack\n![previous](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/keyboard_arrow_left.svg)\n![next](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/keyboard_arrow_right.svg)\n[Dart language](https://dart.dev/)[Report package](https://pub.dev/report?subject=package%3Asignals_flutter&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpub.dev%2Fpackages%2Fsignals_flutter)[Policy](https://pub.dev/policy)[Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)[API Terms](https://developers.google.com/terms/)[Security](https://pub.dev/security)[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/)[Help](https://pub.dev/help)[![RSS](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/rss-feed-icon.svg \"RSS/atom feed\")](https://pub.dev/feed.atom)[![bug report](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/bug-report-white-96px.png \"Report an issue with this site\")](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub-dev/issues/new)",
