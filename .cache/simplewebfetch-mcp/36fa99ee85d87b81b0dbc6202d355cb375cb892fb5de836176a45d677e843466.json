The cognitive load of moving data manually between these silos is real.\nRecently, I’ve integrated the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** into my workflow. If you aren’t familiar with it, MCP is an open standard that enables AI assistants (like Claude or IDE-integrated agents) to connect directly to your local tools and data sources.
