Signals can be used in any Dart project!\nLazy evaluation\nSignals are lazy and will only compute values when read. If a signal is not read, it will not be computed.\nFlexible API\nEvery app is different and signals can be composed in multiple ways. There are a few rules to follow but the API surface is small.\nSurgical Rendering\nWidgets can be rebuilt surgically, only marking dirty the parts of the Widget tree that need to be updated and if mounted.\n[media](https://dartpad.dev/?id=1b2f58d30c33ee2ee5c5a159b8867861?theme=dark)",
