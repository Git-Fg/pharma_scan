[Patterns](https://dart.dev/language/patterns)\n# Patterns\nSummary of patterns in Dart.\nmore\\_vert\n-   copyCopy link\n-   [docsView source](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/blob/main/src/content/language/patterns.md)\n-   [bug\\_reportReport issue](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/issues/new?template=1_page_issue.yml&page-url=https://dart.dev/language/patterns&page-source=https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/blob/main/src/content/language/patterns.md)\nmerge\\_type Version note\nPatterns require a [language version](https://dart.dev/resources/language/evolution#language-versioning) of at least 3.0.\nPatterns are a syntactic category in the Dart language, like statements and expressions. A pattern represents the shape of a set of values that it may match against actual values.\nThis page describes:\n-   What patterns do.\n-   Where patterns are allowed in Dart code.\n-   What the common use cases for patterns are.\nTo learn about the different kinds of patterns, visit the [pattern types](https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types) page.\n## What patterns do\n[#](#what-patterns-do)\nIn general, a pattern may **match** a value, **destructure** a value, or both, depending on the context and shape of the pattern.\nFirst, _pattern matching_ allows you to check whether a given value:\n-   Has a certain shape.\n-   Is a certain constant.\n-   Is equal to something else.\n-   Has a certain type.\nThen, _pattern destructuring_ provides you with a convenient declarative syntax to break that value into its constituent parts. The same pattern can also let you bind variables to some or all of those parts in the process.\n### Matching\n[#](#matching)\nA pattern always tests against a value to determine if the value has the form you expect. In other words, you are checking if the value _matches_ the pattern.\nWhat constitutes a match depends on [what kind of pattern](https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types) you are using. For example, a constant pattern matches if the value is equal to the pattern's constant:\ndart\n```\nswitch (number) {\n  // Constant pattern matches if 1 == number.\n  case 1:\n    print('one');\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nMany patterns make use of subpatterns, sometimes called _outer_ and _inner_ patterns, respectively. Patterns match recursively on their subpatterns. For example, the individual fields of any [collection-type](https://dart.dev/language/collections) pattern could be [variable patterns](https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#variable) or [constant patterns](https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#constant):\ndart\n```\nconst a = 'a';\nconst b = 'b';\nswitch (obj) {\n  // List pattern [a, b] matches obj first if obj is a list with two fields,\n  // then if its fields match the constant subpatterns 'a' and 'b'.\n  case [a, b]:\n    print('$a, $b');\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nTo ignore parts of a matched value, you can use a [wildcard pattern](https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#wildcard) as a placeholder. In the case of list patterns, you can use a [rest element](https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#rest-element).\n### Destructuring\n[#](#destructuring)\nWhen an object and pattern match, the pattern can then access the object's data and extract it in parts. In other words, the pattern _destructures_ the object:\ndart\n```\nvar numList = [1, 2, 3];\n// List pattern [a, b, c] destructures the three elements from numList...\nvar [a, b, c] = numList;\n// ...and assigns them to new variables.\nprint(a + b + c);\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nYou can nest [any kind of pattern](https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types) inside a destructuring pattern. For example, this case pattern matches and destructures a two-element list whose first element is `'a'` or `'b'`:\ndart\n```\nswitch (list) {\n  case ['a' || 'b', var c]:\n    print(c);\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n## Places patterns can appear\n[#](#places-patterns-can-appear)\nYou can use patterns in several places in the Dart language:\n-   Local variable [declarations](#variable-declaration) and [assignments](#variable-assignment)\n-   [for and for-in loops](https://dart.dev/language/loops#for-loops)\n-   [if-case](https://dart.dev/language/branches#if-case) and [switch-case](https://dart.dev/language/branches#switch-statements)\n-   Control flow in [collection literals](https://dart.dev/language/collections#control-flow-operators)\nThis section describes common use cases for matching and destructuring with patterns.\n### Variable declaration\n[#](#variable-declaration)\nYou can use a _pattern variable declaration_ anywhere Dart allows local variable declaration. The pattern matches against the value on the right of the declaration. Once matched, it destructures the value and binds it to new local variables:\ndart\n```\n// Declares new variables a, b, and c.\nvar (a, [b, c]) = ('str', [1, 2]);\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nA pattern variable declaration must start with either `var` or `final`, followed by a pattern.\n### Variable assignment\n[#](#variable-assignment)\nA _variable assignment pattern_ falls on the left side of an assignment. First, it destructures the matched object. Then it assigns the values to _existing_ variables, instead of binding new ones.\nUse a variable assignment pattern to swap the values of two variables without declaring a third temporary one:\ndart\n```\nvar (a, b) = ('left', 'right');\n(b, a) = (a, b); // Swap.\nprint('$a $b'); // Prints \"right left\".\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n### Switch statements and expressions\n[#](#switch-statements-and-expressions)\nEvery case clause contains a pattern. This applies to [switch statements](https://dart.dev/language/branches#switch-statements) and [expressions](https://dart.dev/language/branches#switch-expressions), as well as [if-case statements](https://dart.dev/language/branches#if-case). You can use [any kind of pattern](https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types) in a case.\n_Case patterns_ are [refutable](https://dart.dev/resources/glossary#refutable-pattern)Refutable patternA pattern that can be tested against a value. [Learn more](https://dart.dev/resources/glossary#refutable-pattern \"Learn more about 'Refutable pattern' and find related resources.\"). They allow control flow to either:\n-   Match and destructure the object being switched on.\n-   Continue execution if the object doesn't match.\nThe values that a pattern destructures in a case become local variables. Their scope is only within the body of that case.\ndart\n```\nswitch (obj) {\n  // Matches if 1 == obj.\n  case 1:\n    print('one');\n​\n  // Matches if the value of obj is between the\n  // constant values of 'first' and 'last'.\n  case >= first && <= last:\n    print('in range');\n​\n  // Matches if obj is a record with two fields,\n  // then assigns the fields to 'a' and 'b'.\n  case (var a, var b):\n    print('a = $a, b = $b');\n​\n  default:\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n[Logical-or patterns](https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#logical-or) are useful for having multiple cases share a body in switch expressions or statements:\ndart\n```\nvar isPrimary = switch (color) {\n  Color.red || Color.yellow || Color.blue => true,\n  _ => false,\n};\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nSwitch statements can have multiple cases share a body [without using logical-or patterns](https://dart.dev/language/branches#switch-share), but they are still uniquely useful for allowing multiple cases to share a [guard](https://dart.dev/language/branches#guard-clause):\ndart\n```\nswitch (shape) {\n  case Square(size: var s) || Circle(size: var s) when s > 0:\n    print('Non-empty symmetric shape');\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n[Guard clauses](https://dart.dev/language/branches#guard-clause) evaluate an arbitrary condition as part of a case, without exiting the switch if the condition is false (like using an `if` statement in the case body would cause).\ndart\n```\nswitch (pair) {\n  case (int a, int b):\n    if (a > b) print('First element greater');\n  // If false, prints nothing and exits the switch.\n  case (int a, int b) when a > b:\n    // If false, prints nothing but proceeds to next case.\n    print('First element greater');\n  case (int a, int b):\n    print('First element not greater');\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n### For and for-in loops\n[#](#for-and-for-in-loops)\nYou can use patterns in [for and for-in loops](https://dart.dev/language/loops#for-loops) to iterate-over and destructure values in a collection.\nThis example uses [object destructuring](https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#object) in a for-in loop to destructure the [`MapEntry`](https://api.dart.dev/dart-core/MapEntry-class.html) objects that a `<Map>.entries` call returns:\ndart\n```\nMap<String, int> hist = {'a': 23, 'b': 100};\n​\nfor (var MapEntry(key: key, value: count) in hist.entries) {\n  print('$key occurred $count times');\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nThe object pattern checks that `hist.entries` has the named type `MapEntry`, and then recurses into the named field subpatterns `key` and `value`. It calls the `key` getter and `value` getter on the `MapEntry` in each iteration, and binds the results to local variables `key` and `count`, respectively.\nBinding the result of a getter call to a variable of the same name is a common use case, so object patterns can also infer the getter name from the [variable subpattern](https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#variable). This allows you to simplify the variable pattern from something redundant like `key: key` to just `:key`:\ndart\n```\nfor (var MapEntry(:key, value: count) in hist.entries) {\n  print('$key occurred $count times');\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n## Use cases for patterns\n[#](#use-cases-for-patterns)\nThe [previous section](#places-patterns-can-appear) describes _how_ patterns fit into other Dart code constructs. You saw some interesting use cases as examples, like [swapping](#variable-assignment) the values of two variables, or [destructuring key-value pairs](#for-and-for-in-loops) in a map. This section describes even more use cases, answering:\n-   _When and why_ you might want to use patterns.\n-   What kinds of problems they solve.\n-   Which idioms they best suit.\n### Destructuring multiple returns\n[#](#destructuring-multiple-returns)\nRecords allow aggregating and [returning multiple values](https://dart.dev/language/records#multiple-returns) from a single function call. Patterns add the ability to destructure a record's fields directly into local variables, inline with the function call.\nInstead of individually declaring new local variables for each record field, like this:\ndart\n```\nvar info = userInfo(json);\nvar name = info.$1;\nvar age = info.$2;\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nYou can destructure the fields of a record that a function returns into local variables using a [variable declaration](#variable-declaration) or [assigment pattern](#variable-assignment), and a [record pattern](https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#record) as its subpattern:\ndart\n```\nvar (name, age) = userInfo(json);\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nTo destructure a record with named fields using a pattern:\ndart\n```\nfinal (:name, :age) =\n    getData(); // For example, return (name: 'doug', age: 25);\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n### Destructuring class instances\n[#](#destructuring-class-instances)\n[Object patterns](https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#object) match against named object types, allowing you to destructure their data using the getters the object's class already exposes.\nTo destructure an instance of a class, use the named type, followed by the properties to destructure enclosed in parentheses:\ndart\n```\nfinal Foo myFoo = Foo(one: 'one', two: 2);\nvar Foo(:one, :two) = myFoo;\nprint('one $one, two $two');\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n### Algebraic data types\n[#](#algebraic-data-types)\nObject destructuring and switch cases are conducive to writing code in an [algebraic data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type) style. Use this method when:\n-   You have a family of related types.\n-   You have an operation that needs specific behavior for each type.\n-   You want to group that behavior in one place instead of spreading it across all the different type definitions.\nInstead of implementing the operation as an instance method for every type, keep the operation's variations in a single function that switches over the subtypes:\ndart\n```\nsealed class Shape {}\n​\nclass Square implements Shape {\n  final double length;\n  Square(this.length);\n}\n​\nclass Circle implements Shape {\n  final double radius;\n  Circle(this.radius);\n}\n​\ndouble calculateArea(Shape shape) => switch (shape) {\n  Square(length: var l) => l * l,\n  Circle(radius: var r) => math.pi * r * r,\n};\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n### Validating incoming JSON\n[#](#validating-incoming-json)\n[Map](https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#map) and [list](https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#list) patterns work well for destructuring key-value pairs in deserialized data, such as data parsed from JSON:\ndart\n```\nvar data = {\n  'user': ['Lily', 13],\n};\nvar {'user': [name, age]} = data;\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nIf you know that the JSON data has the structure you expect, the previous example is realistic. But data typically comes from an external source, like over the network. You need to validate it first to confirm its structure.\nWithout patterns, validation is verbose:\ndart\n```\nif (data is Map<String, Object?> &&\n    data.length == 1 &&\n    data.containsKey('user')) {\n  var user = data['user'];\n  if (user is List<Object> &&\n      user.length == 2 &&\n      user[0] is String &&\n      user[1] is int) {\n    var name = user[0] as String;\n    var age = user[1] as int;\n    print('User $name is $age years old.');\n  }\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nA single [case pattern](#switch-statements-and-expressions) can achieve the same validation. Single cases work best as [if-case](https://dart.dev/language/branches#if-case) statements. Patterns provide a more declarative, and much less verbose method of validating JSON:\ndart\n```\nif (data case {'user': [String name, int age]}) {\n  print('User $name is $age years old.');\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nThis case pattern simultaneously validates that:\n-   `json` is a map, because it must first match the outer [map pattern](https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#map) to proceed.\n    -   And, since it's a map, it also confirms `json` is not null.\n-   `json` contains a key `user`.\n-   The key `user` pairs with a list of two values.\n-   The types of the list values are `String` and `int`.\n-   The new local variables to hold the values are `name` and `age`.\n[chevron\\_left\nPrevious Type system\n](https://dart.dev/language/type-system)[\nNext Pattern types\nchevron\\_right](https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types)\nWas this page's content helpful?\nthumb\\_up thumb\\_down\nUnless stated otherwise, the documentation on this site reflects Dart 3.10.3.
