[build\\_runner](https://dart.dev/tools/build_runner)\n# build\\_runner\nA tool for building, testing, and running Dart code.\nmore\\_vert\n-   copyCopy link\n-   [docsView source](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/blob/main/src/content/tools/build_runner.md)\n-   [bug\\_reportReport issue](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/issues/new?template=1_page_issue.yml&page-url=https://dart.dev/tools/build_runner&page-source=https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/blob/main/src/content/tools/build_runner.md)\nThe [build\\_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) package provides general-purpose commands for generating files, including testing the generated files or serving both source and generated files. This page explains how to use `build_runner`. To learn how to use build\\_runner with a specific package, see the documentation for that package.\ninfoNote\nIf you're a web developer, use the [`webdev` tool](https://dart.dev/tools/webdev) to build and serve web apps.\nThe build\\_runner commands work with _builders_—packages that use the [Dart build system](https://github.com/dart-lang/build) to generate output files from input files. For example, the [json\\_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) and [built\\_value\\_generator](https://pub.dev/packages/built_value_generator) packages define builders that generate Dart code.\nAlthough the Dart build system is a good alternative to reflection (which has performance issues) and macros (which Dart's compilers don't support), it can do more than just read and write Dart code. For example, the [sass\\_builder](https://pub.dev/packages/sass_builder) package implements a builder that generates `.css` files from `.scss` and `.sass` files.\n## Setting up build\\_runner\n[#](#setting-up-build_runner)\nTo use build\\_runner, add a [dev dependency](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/dependencies#dev-dependencies) on **build\\_runner** to your app's pubspec:\nyaml\n```\ndev_dependencies:\n  # ···\n  build_runner: ^2.10.4\n  build_test: ^3.5.4\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nDepending on **build\\_test** is optional; do it if you'll be testing your code.\nAs usual after `pubspec.yaml` changes, run `dart pub get` or `dart pub upgrade`:\n```\n$ dart pub get\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n## Using built-in commands\n[#](#using-built-in-commands)\nThe following is an example of using the build\\_runner **build** command:\n```\n$ # From a directory that contains a pubspec.yaml file:\n$ dart run build_runner build\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nThe build\\_runner package includes the following commands:\nbuild\nPerforms a one-time build.\nserve\nRuns a development server. Instead of directly using this command, you can use [`webdev serve`,](https://dart.dev/tools/webdev#serve) which has convenient default behavior.\ntest\nRuns [tests.](https://dart.dev/tools/testing)\nwatch\nLaunches a build server that watches for edits to input files. Responds to changes by performing incremental rebuilds.\n## More information\n[#](#more-information)\n-   [webdev](https://dart.dev/tools/webdev) guide (use if you're working on web-specific code)\n-   [build\\_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) guide\n-   [packages with the `build_runner` dependency](https://pub.dev/packages?q=dependency%3Abuild_runner)\n-   [packages with the `build` dependency](https://pub.dev/packages?q=dependency%3Abuild)\nWas this page's content helpful?\nthumb\\_up thumb\\_down\nUnless stated otherwise, the documentation on this site reflects Dart 3.10.3.
