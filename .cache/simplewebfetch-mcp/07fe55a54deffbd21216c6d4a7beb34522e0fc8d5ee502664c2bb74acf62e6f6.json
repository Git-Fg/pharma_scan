[Check app functionality with an integration test](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/integration-tests)\n# Check app functionality with an integration test\nLearn how to write integration tests\nmore\\_vert\n-   copyCopy link\n-   [docsView source](https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/src/content/testing/integration-tests/index.md)\n-   [bug\\_reportReport issue](https://github.com/flutter/website/issues/new?template=1_page_issue.yml&page-url=https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/integration-tests&page-source=https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/src/content/testing/integration-tests/index.md)\n## Introduction\n[#](#introduction)\nThis guide describes how to run integration tests with your Flutter app. With it, you'll learn how to do the following:\n-   Set up integration tests.\n-   Verify if an app displays specific text.\n-   Tap specific widgets.\n-   Run integration tests.\nThe guide references the `counter_app` project that comes with Flutter and the Flutter [`integration_test`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/main/packages/integration_test#integration_test) package. The `integration_test` package lets you:\n-   Use the `flutter drive` command to run tests on a physical device or emulator.\n-   Run on [Firebase Test Lab](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab), to automate testing on a variety of devices.\n-   Use [flutter\\_test](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/flutter_test-library.html) APIs to write tests in a style similar to [widget tests](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/overview#widget-tests).\n## Create a new app to test\n[#](#create-a-new-app-to-test)\nIntegration testing requires an app to test. This example uses the built-in **Counter App** example that Flutter produces when you run the `flutter create` command. The counter app allows a user to tap on a button to increase a counter.\n1.  To create an instance of the built-in Flutter app, run the following command in your terminal:\n    ```\n    $ flutter create counter_app\n    ```\n    content\\_copy\n2.  Change into the `counter_app` directory.\n3.  Open `lib/main.dart` in your preferred IDE.\n4.  Add a `key` parameter to the `floatingActionButton()` widget with an instance of a `Key` class with a string value of `increment`.\n    dart\n    ```\n     floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(\n       key: const ValueKey('increment'),\n       onPressed: _incrementCounter,\n       tooltip: 'Increment',\n       child: const Icon(Icons.add),\n     ),\n    ```\n    content\\_copy\n5.  Save your `lib/main.dart` file.\nAfter these changes, the `lib/main.dart` file should resemble the following code.\nlib/main.dart\ndart\n```\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n​\nvoid main() => runApp(const MyApp());\n​\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  const MyApp({super.key});\n​\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return const MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Counter App',\n      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Counter App Home Page'),\n    );\n  }\n}\n​\nclass MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {\n  const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.title});\n​\n  final String title;\n​\n  @override\n  State<MyHomePage> createState() => _MyHomePageState();\n}\n​\nclass _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {\n  int _counter = 0;\n​\n  void _incrementCounter() {\n    setState(() {\n      _counter++;\n    });\n  }\n​\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(title: Text(widget.title)),\n      body: Center(\n        child: Column(\n          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n          children: <Widget>[\n            const Text('You have pushed the button this many times:'),\n            Text(\n              '$_counter',\n              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium,\n            ),\n          ],\n        ),\n      ),\n      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(\n        // Provide a Key to this button. This allows finding this\n        // specific button inside the test suite, and tapping it.\n        key: const Key('increment'),\n        onPressed: _incrementCounter,\n        tooltip: 'Increment',\n        child: const Icon(Icons.add),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n## Add the `integration_test` dependency\n[#](#add-the-integration-test-dependency)\nYou need to add the testing packages to your new app.\nTo add `integration_test` and `flutter_test` packages as `dev_dependencies` using `sdk: flutter`, run following command.\n```\n$ flutter pub add 'dev:integration_test:{\"sdk\":\"flutter\"}'\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nOutput:\n```\nBuilding flutter tool...\nResolving dependencies...\nGot dependencies.\nResolving dependencies...\n+ file 7.0.0\n+ flutter_driver 0.0.0 from sdk flutter\n+ fuchsia_remote_debug_protocol 0.0.0 from sdk flutter\n+ integration_test 0.0.0 from sdk flutter\n...\n  test_api 0.6.1 (0.7.1 available)\n  vm_service 13.0.0 (14.2.1 available)\n+ webdriver 3.0.3\nChanged 8 dependencies!\n7 packages have newer versions incompatible with dependency constraints.\nTry `flutter pub outdated` for more information.\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nUpdated `pubspec.yaml` file:\npubspec.yaml\nyaml\n```\n# ...\ndev_dependencies:\n  # ... added dependencies\n  flutter_test:\n    sdk: flutter\n  flutter_lints: ^6.0.0\n  integration_test:\n    sdk: flutter\n# ...\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n## Create the integration test files\n[#](#create-the-integration-test-files)\nIntegration tests reside in a separate directory inside your Flutter project.\n1.  Create a new directory named `integration_test`.\n2.  Add empty file named `app_test.dart` in that directory.\nThe resulting directory tree should resemble the following:\n```\ncounter_app/\n  lib/\n    main.dart\n  integration_test/\n    app_test.dart\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n## Write the integration test\n[#](#write-the-integration-test)\nThe integration test file consists of a Dart code file with dependencies on `integration_test`, `flutter_test`, and your app's Dart file.\n1.  Open your `integration_test/app_test.dart` file in your preferred IDE.\n2.  Copy the following code and paste it into your `integration_test/app_test.dart` file. The last import should point to the `main.dart` file of your `counter_app`. (This `import` points to the example app called `introduction`.)\n    integration\\_test/counter\\_test.dart\n    dart\n    ```\n    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n    import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';\n    import 'package:how_to/main.dart';\n    import 'package:integration_test/integration_test.dart';\n    ​\n    void main() {\n      IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n    ​\n      group('end-to-end test', () {\n        testWidgets('tap on the floating action button, verify counter', (\n          tester,\n        ) async {\n          // Load app widget.\n          await tester.pumpWidget(const MyApp());\n    ​\n          // Verify the counter starts at 0.\n          expect(find.text('0'), findsOneWidget);\n    ​\n          // Finds the floating action button to tap on.\n          final fab = find.byKey(const ValueKey('increment'));\n    ​\n          // Emulate a tap on the floating action button.\n          await tester.tap(fab);\n    ​\n          // Trigger a frame.\n          await tester.pumpAndSettle();\n    ​\n          // Verify the counter increments by 1.\n          expect(find.text('1'), findsOneWidget);\n        });\n      });\n    }\n    ```\n    content\\_copy\nThis example goes through three steps:\n1.  Initialize `IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding`. This singleton service executes tests on a physical device.\n2.  Interact and test widgets using the `WidgetTester` class.\n3.  Test the important scenarios.\n## Run integration tests\n[#](#run-integration-tests)\nThe integration tests that run vary depending on the platform on which you test.\n-   To test a desktop platform, use the command line or a CI system.\n-   To test a mobile platform, use the command line or Firebase Test Lab.\n-   To test in a web browser, use the command line.\n---\n### Test on a desktop platform\n[#](#test-on-a-desktop-platform)\nExpand if you test Linux apps using a CI system\nTo test a Linux app, your CI system must invoke an X server first. In the GitHub Action, GitLab Runner, or similar configuration file, set the integration test to work _with_ the `xvfb-run` tool.\nDoing this invokes an X Window system into which Flutter can launch and test your Linux app.\nAs an example using GitHub Actions, your `jobs.setup.steps` should include a step resembling the following:\nyaml\n```\n      - name: Run Integration Tests\n        uses: username/xvfb-action@v1.1.2\n        with:\n          run: flutter test integration_test -d linux -r github\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nThis starts the integration test within an X Window.\nIf you don't configure your integration in this way, Flutter returns an error.\n```\nBuilding Linux application...\nError waiting for a debug connection: The log reader stopped unexpectedly, or never started.\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nTo test on a macOS, Windows, or Linux platform, complete the following tasks.\n1.  Run the following command from the root of the project.\n    ```\n    $ flutter test integration_test/app_test.dart\n    ```\n    content\\_copy\n2.  If offered a choice of platform to test, choose the desktop platform. Type `1` to choose the desktop platform.\nBased on platform, the command result should resemble the following output.\n-   [Windows](#135-tab-panel)\n-   [macOS](#136-tab-panel)\n-   [Linux](#137-tab-panel)\n```\nPS C:\\path\\to\\counter_app> flutter test .\\integration_test\\app_test.dart\nResolving dependencies...\nDownloading packages...\n  flutter_lints 3.0.2 (4.0.0 available)\n  leak_tracker 10.0.4 (10.0.5 available)\n  leak_tracker_flutter_testing 3.0.3 (3.0.5 available)\n  lints 3.0.0 (4.0.0 available)\n  material_color_utilities 0.8.0 (0.11.1 available)\n  meta 1.12.0 (1.15.0 available)\n  test_api 0.7.0 (0.7.1 available)\n  vm_service 14.2.1 (14.2.2 available)\nGot dependencies!\n8 packages have newer versions incompatible with dependency constraints.\nTry `flutter pub outdated` for more information.\nConnected devices:\nWindows (desktop) • windows • windows-x64    • Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.22631.3593]\nChrome (web)      • chrome  • web-javascript • Google Chrome 124.0.6367.207\nEdge (web)        • edge    • web-javascript • Microsoft Edge 124.0.2478.97\n[1]: Windows (windows)\n[2]: Chrome (chrome)\n[3]: Edge (edge)\nPlease choose one (or \"q\" to quit): 1\n00:00 +0: loading C:/path/to/counter_app/integration_test/app_test.dart               B\n00:29 +0: loading C:/path/to/counter_app/counter_app/integration_test/app_test.dart   29.1s\n√ Built build\\windows\\x64\\runner\\Debug\\counter_app.exe\n00:31 +1: All tests passed!\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n$ flutter test integration_test\nResolving dependencies...\nDownloading packages...\n  flutter_lints 3.0.2 (4.0.0 available)\n> leak_tracker 10.0.4 (was 10.0.0) (10.0.5 available)\n> leak_tracker_flutter_testing 3.0.3 (was 2.0.1) (3.0.5 available)\n> leak_tracker_testing 3.0.1 (was 2.0.1)\n  lints 3.0.0 (4.0.0 available)\n  material_color_utilities 0.8.0 (0.11.1 available)\n> meta 1.12.0 (was 1.11.0) (1.15.0 available)\n> test_api 0.7.0 (was 0.6.1) (0.7.1 available)\n> vm_service 14.2.1 (was 13.0.0) (14.2.2 available)\nChanged 6 dependencies!\n8 packages have newer versions incompatible with dependency constraints.\nTry `flutter pub outdated` for more information.\nConnected devices:\nmacOS (desktop)                 • macos                 • darwin-arm64   • macOS 14.4.1 23E224 darwin-arm64\nMac Designed for iPad (desktop) • mac-designed-for-ipad • darwin         • macOS 14.4.1 23E224 darwin-arm64\nChrome (web)                    • chrome                • web-javascript • Google Chrome 124.0.6367.208\nNo wireless devices were found.\n[1]: macOS (macos)\n[2]: Mac Designed for iPad (mac-designed-for-ipad)\n[3]: Chrome (chrome)\nPlease choose one (or \"q\" to quit): 1\n00:01 +0: loading /path/to/counter_app/integration_test/app_test.dart        R\n00:02 +0: loading /path/to/counter_app/integration_test/app_test.dart    846ms\n00:03 +0: loading /path/to/counter_app/integration_test/app_test.dart        B\nBuilding macOS application...\n✓ Built build/macos/Build/Products/Debug/counter_app.app\n00:32 +1: All tests passed!\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n$ flutter test integration_test/app_test.dart\nConnected devices:\nLinux (desktop) • linux  • linux-x64      • Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS 6.5.0-35-generic\nChrome (web)    • chrome • web-javascript • Google Chrome 104.0.5112.101\n[1]: Linux (linux)\n[2]: Chrome (chrome)\nPlease choose one (or \"q\" to quit): 1\n00:00 +0: /path/to/counter_app/integration_test/app_test.dart     B\n00:16 +0: /path/to/counter_app/integration_test/app_test.dart\n✓ Built build/linux/x64/debug/bundle/counter_app\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n---\n### Test on an Android device\n[#](#test-on-an-android-device)\nTo test on a real Android device, complete the following tasks.\n1.
