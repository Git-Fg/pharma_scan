If a signal is not read, it will not be computed\n-   🗜️ **Flexible API**: Every app is different and signals can be composed in multiple ways. There are a few rules to follow but the API surface is small\n-   🔬 **Surgical Rendering**: Widgets can be rebuilt surgically, only marking dirty the parts of the Widget tree that need to be updated and if mounted\n-   💙 **100% Dart Native**: Supports Dart JS (HTML), Shelf Server, CLI (and Native), VM, Flutter (Web, Mobile and Desktop). Signals can be used in any Dart project\nTo start using signals, check out the full [documentation](https://dartsignals.dev/).\n## Quick Start [#](#quick-start)\nThe signals library exposes four functions which are the building blocks to model any business logic you can think of.\n### `signal(initialValue)` [#](#signalinitialvalue)\nThe `signal` function creates a new signal. A signal is a container for a value that can change over time. You can read a signal's value or subscribe to value updates by accessing its `.value` property.\n```dart\nimport 'package:signals/signals.dart';\nfinal counter = signal(0);\n// Read value from signal, logs: 0\nprint(counter.value);\n// Write to a signal\ncounter.value = 1;\n```\nWriting to a signal is done by setting its `.value` property. Changing a signal's value synchronously updates every [computed](#computedfn) and [effect](#effectfn) that depends on that signal, ensuring your app state is always consistent.\n#### `signal.peek()`\nIn the rare instance that you have an effect that should write to another signal based on the previous value, but you _don't_ want the effect to be subscribed to that signal, you can read a signals's previous value via `signal.peek()`.\n```dart\nfinal counter = signal(0);\nfinal effectCount = signal(0);\neffect(() {\n\tprint(counter.value);\n\t// Whenever this effect is triggered, increase `effectCount`.\n\t// But we don't want this signal to react to `effectCount`\n\teffectCount.value = effectCount.peek() + 1;\n});\n```\nNote that you should only use `signal.peek()` if you really need it. Reading a signal's value via `signal.value` is the preferred way in most scenarios.\n### `untracked(fn)` [#](#untrackedfn)\nIn case when you're receiving a callback that can read some signals, but you don't want to subscribe to them, you can use `untracked` to prevent any subscriptions from happening.\n```dart\nfinal counter = signal(0);\nfinal effectCount = signal(0);\nfinal fn = () => effectCount.value + 1;\neffect(() {\n\tprint(counter.value);\n\t// Whenever this effect is triggered, run `fn` that gives new value\n\teffectCount.value = untracked(fn);\n});\n```\n### `computed(fn)` [#](#computedfn)\nData is often derived from other pieces of existing data. The `computed` function lets you combine the values of multiple signals into a new signal that can be reacted to, or even used by additional computeds. When the signals accessed from within a computed callback change, the computed callback is re-executed and its new return value becomes the computed signal's value.\n```dart\nimport 'package:signals/signals.dart';\nfinal name = signal(\"Jane\");\nfinal surname = signal(\"Doe\");\nfinal fullName = computed(() => name.value + \" \" + surname.value);\n// Logs: \"Jane Doe\"\nprint(fullName.value);\n// Updates flow through computed, but only if someone\n// subscribes to it. More on that later.\nname.value = \"John\";\n// Logs: \"John Doe\"\nprint(fullName.value);\n```\nAny signal that is accessed inside the `computed`'s callback function will be automatically subscribed to and tracked as a dependency of the computed signal.\n### `effect(fn)` [#](#effectfn)\nThe `effect` function is the last piece that makes everything reactive. When you access a signal inside an `effect`'s callback function, that signal and every dependency of said signal will be activated and subscribed to. In that regard it is very similar to [`computed(fn)`](#computedfn). By default all updates are lazy, so nothing will update until you access a signal inside `effect`.\n```dart\nimport 'package:signals/signals.dart';\nfinal name = signal(\"Jane\");\nfinal surname = signal(\"Doe\");\nfinal fullName = computed(() => name.value + \" \" + surname.value);\n// Logs: \"Jane Doe\"\neffect(() => print(fullName.value));\n// Updating one of its dependencies will automatically trigger\n// the effect above, and will print \"John Doe\" to the console.\nname.value = \"John\";\n```\nYou can destroy an effect and unsubscribe from all signals it was subscribed to, by calling the returned function.\n```dart\nimport 'package:signals/signals.dart';\nfinal name = signal(\"Jane\");\nfinal surname = signal(\"Doe\");\nfinal fullName = computed(() => name.value + \" \" + surname.value);\n// Logs: \"Jane Doe\"\nfinal dispose = effect(() => print(fullName.value));\n// Destroy effect and subscriptions\ndispose();\n// Update does nothing, because no one is subscribed anymore.\n// Even the computed `fullName` signal won't change, because it knows\n// that no one listens to it.\nsurname.value = \"Doe 2\";\n```\n#### Warning Cycles\nMutating a signal inside an effect will cause an infinite loop, because the effect will be triggered again. To prevent this, you can use [`untracked(fn)`](#untrackedfn) to read a signal without subscribing to it.\n```dart\nimport 'dart:async';\nimport 'package:signals/signals.dart';\nFuture<void> main() async {\n  final completer = Completer<void>();\n  final age = signal(0);\n  effect(() {\n    print('You are ${age.value} years old');\n    age.value++; // <-- This will throw a cycle error\n  });\n  await completer.future;\n}\n```\n### `batch(fn)` [#](#batchfn)\nThe `batch` function allows you to combine multiple signal writes into one single update that is triggered at the end when the callback completes.\n```dart\nimport 'package:signals/signals.dart';\nfinal name = signal(\"Jane\");\nfinal surname = signal(\"Doe\");\nfinal fullName = computed(() => name.value + \" \" + surname.value);\n// Logs: \"Jane Doe\"\neffect(() => print(fullName.value));\n// Combines both signal writes into one update. Once the callback\n// returns the `effect` will trigger and we'll log \"Foo Bar\"\nbatch(() {\n\tname.value = \"Foo\";\n\tsurname.value = \"Bar\";\n});\n```\nWhen you access a signal that you wrote to earlier inside the callback, or access a computed signal that was invalidated by another signal, we'll only update the necessary dependencies to get the current value for the signal you read from. All other invalidated signals will update at the end of the callback function.\n```dart\nimport 'package:signals/signals.dart';\nfinal counter = signal(0);\nfinal _double = computed(() => counter.value * 2);\nfinal _triple = computed(() => counter.value * 3);\neffect(() => print(_double.value, _triple.value));\nbatch(() {\n\tcounter.value = 1;\n\t// Logs: 2, despite being inside batch, but `triple`\n\t// will only update once the callback is complete\n\tprint(_double.value);\n});\n// Now we reached the end of the batch and call the effect\n```\nBatches can be nested and updates will be flushed when the outermost batch call completes.\n```dart\nimport 'package:signals/signals.dart';\nfinal counter = signal(0);\neffect(() => print(counter.value));\nbatch(() {\n\tbatch(() {\n\t\t// Signal is invalidated, but update is not flushed because\n\t\t// we're still inside another batch\n\t\tcounter.value = 1;\n\t});\n\t// Still not updated...\n});\n// Now the callback completed and we'll trigger the effect.\n```\n### Flutter [#](#flutter)\nTo make signals reactive in Flutter, you can use the `createSignal`/`createComputed` function inside a stateful widget.\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:signals/signals_flutter.dart';\nclass Counter extends StatefulWidget {\n  @override\n  _CounterState createState() => _CounterState();\n}\nclass _CounterState extends State<Counter> with SignalsMixin {\n  late final counter = createSignal(0);\n  late final isEven = createComputed(() => counter.value.isEven);\n  late final isOdd = createComputed(() => counter.value.isOdd);\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n\treturn Column(\n\t  children: [\n\t\tText('Counter: $counter'), // <- No need to use .value since .toString() is overridden to return the value\n\t\tText('Is Even: $isEven'),\n\t\tText('Is Odd: $isOdd'),\n\t\tElevatedButton(\n\t\t  onPressed: () => counter.value++,\n\t\t  child: Text('Increment'),\n\t\t),\n\t  ],\n\t);\n  }\n}\n```\nThe `SignalsMixin` is a mixin that automatically disposes all signals created in the state when the widget is removed from the widget tree.\n#### Fine Grained Rebuilding\nBy default signals will rebuild the widget that is using the signal.\nIf you want to rebuild sub-widgets, you can use the `Watch` widget in combination with a signal created with `signal`/`computed`.\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:signals/signals_flutter.dart';\nclass Counter extends StatefulWidget {\n  @override\n  _CounterState createState() => _CounterState();\n}\nclass _CounterState extends State<Counter> {\n  final counter = signal(0);\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n\treturn Column(\n\t  children: [\n\t\tWatch((context) => Text('Counter: $counter')),\n\t\tElevatedButton(\n\t\t  onPressed: () => counter.value++,\n\t\t  child: Text('Increment'),\n\t\t),\n\t  ],\n\t);\n  }\n}\n```\nThere is a drop in replacement for `Builder` in the `Watch` widget that will rebuild the widget when the signal changes.\n```diff\n- Builder(builder: (context) {\n+ Watch.builder(builder: (context) {\n  return Text('Counter: $counter');\n});\n```\nThere is also the `.watch(context)` extension method that can be used to rebuild a widget when a signal changes.\n```dart\n...\nfinal counter = signal(0);\n...\n@override\nWidget build(BuildContext context) {\n  return Column(\n\tchildren: [\n\t  Text('Counter: ${counter.watch(context)}'),\n\t  ElevatedButton(\n\t\tonPressed: () => counter.value++,\n\t\tchild: Text('Increment'),\n\t  ),\n\t],\n  );\n}\n```\n## DevTools [#](#devtools)\nThere is an early version of a devtools extension included with this package.\n![](https://github.com/rodydavis/signals.dart/blob/main/packages/signals//doc/screenshots/graph.png?raw=true) ![](https://github.com/rodydavis/signals.dart/blob/main/packages/signals//doc/screenshots/list.png?raw=true)\n## Other packages [#](#other-packages)\n| Package | Pub |\n| --- | --- |\n| `signals_core` | [![signals_core](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/signals_core.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/signals_core) |\n| `signals_flutter` | [![signals_flutter](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/signals_flutter.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/signals_flutter) |\n| `signals_lint` | [![signals_lint](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/signals_lint.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/signals_lint) |\n[\n646\nlikes\n160\npoints\n7.7k\ndownloads\n](https://pub.dev/packages/signals/score)\n![screenshot](https://pub.dev/packages/signals/versions/6.3.0/gen-res/gen/190x190/doc/screenshots/graph.webp \"View screenshots\")\n![](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/collections_white_24dp.svg)\n### Publisher\n[![verified publisher](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/material-icon-verified.svg \"Published by a pub.dev verified publisher\")rodydavis.com](https://pub.dev/publishers/rodydavis.com)\n### Weekly Downloads\n### Metadata\nReactivity made simple.
