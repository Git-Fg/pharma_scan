[Dart-enabled IDEs](https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors) typically present the issues identified by the analyzer in their UI. Alternatively, the analyzer can be invoked manually by running `flutter analyze`.\n## Usage [#](#usage)\nFlutter apps, packages, and plugins created with `flutter create` starting with Flutter version 2.3.0 are already set up to use the lints defined in this package. Entities created before that version can use these lints by following these instructions:\n1.  Depend on this package as a **dev\\_dependency** by running `flutter pub add dev:flutter_lints`.\n2.  Create an `analysis_options.yaml` file at the root of the package (alongside the `pubspec.yaml` file) and `include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml` from it.\nExample `analysis_options.yaml` file:\n```yaml\n# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to\n# check for errors, warnings, and lints.\n#\n# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled\n# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be\n# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.\n# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,\n# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.\ninclude: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml\nlinter:\n  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the\n  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`\n  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints\n  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/tools/linter-rules.\n  #\n  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the\n  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code\n  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and\n  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file\n  # producing the lint.\n  rules:\n    # avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule\n    # prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule\n# Additional information about this file can be found at\n# https://dart.dev/tools/analysis\n```\n## Adding new lints [#](#adding-new-lints)\nPlease file a [lint proposal](https://github.com/dart-lang/lints/issues/new?&labels=type-lint&template=lint-propoposal.md) issue to suggest that an existing lint rule should be added to this package. The benefits and risks of adding a lint should be discussed on that issue with all stakeholders involved. The suggestions will be reviewed periodically (typically once a year). Following a review, the package will be updated with all lints that made the cut.\nAdding a lint to the package may create new warnings for existing users and is therefore considered to be a breaking change, which will require a major version bump. To keep churn low, lints are not added one-by-one, but in one batch following a review of all accumulated suggestions since the previous review.\n[\n1.32k\nlikes\n160\npoints\n3.94M\ndownloads\n](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints/score)\n### Publisher\n[![verified publisher](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/material-icon-verified.svg \"Published by a pub.dev verified publisher\")flutter.dev](https://pub.dev/publishers/flutter.dev)\n### Weekly Downloads\n### Metadata\nRecommended lints for Flutter apps, packages, and plugins to encourage good coding practices.\n[Repository (GitHub)](https://github.com/flutter/packages/tree/main/packages/flutter_lints)\n[View/report issues](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22p%3A+flutter_lints%22)\n[Contributing](https://github.com/flutter/packages/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n### Topics\n[#lints](https://pub.dev/packages?q=topic%3Alints)\n### Documentation\n[API reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_lints/latest/)\n### License\n![](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/material-icon-balance.svg)BSD-3-Clause ([license](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints/license))\n### Dependencies\n[lints](https://pub.dev/packages/lints \"^6.0.0\")\n### More\n[Packages that depend on flutter\\_lints](https://pub.dev/packages?q=dependency%3Aflutter_lints)\n### ← Metadata\n[\n1.32k\nlikes\n160\npoints\n3.94M\ndownloads\n](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints/score)\n### Publisher\n[![verified publisher](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/material-icon-verified.svg \"Published by a pub.dev verified publisher\")flutter.dev](https://pub.dev/publishers/flutter.dev)\n### Weekly Downloads\n### Metadata\nRecommended lints for Flutter apps, packages, and plugins to encourage good coding practices.\n[Repository (GitHub)](https://github.com/flutter/packages/tree/main/packages/flutter_lints)\n[View/report issues](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22p%3A+flutter_lints%22)\n[Contributing](https://github.com/flutter/packages/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n### Topics\n[#lints](https://pub.dev/packages?q=topic%3Alints)\n### Documentation\n[API reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_lints/latest/)\n### License\n![](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/material-icon-balance.svg)BSD-3-Clause ([license](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints/license))\n### Dependencies\n[lints](https://pub.dev/packages/lints \"^6.0.0\")\n### More\n[Packages that depend on flutter\\_lints](https://pub.dev/packages?q=dependency%3Aflutter_lints)\nBack\n![previous](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/keyboard_arrow_left.svg)\n![next](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/keyboard_arrow_right.svg)\n[Dart language](https://dart.dev/)[Report package](https://pub.dev/report?subject=package%3Aflutter_lints&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpub.dev%2Fpackages%2Fflutter_lints)[Policy](https://pub.dev/policy)[Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)[API Terms](https://developers.google.com/terms/)[Security](https://pub.dev/security)[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/)[Help](https://pub.dev/help)[![RSS](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/rss-feed-icon.svg \"RSS/atom feed\")](https://pub.dev/feed.atom)[![bug report](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/bug-report-white-96px.png \"Report an issue with this site\")](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub-dev/issues/new)",
