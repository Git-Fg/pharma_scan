[Adaptive design](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive)\n# Adaptive and responsive design in Flutter\nIt's important to create an app, whether for mobile or web, that responds to size and orientation changes and maximizes the use of each platform.\nmore\\_vert\n-   copyCopy link\n-   [docsView source](https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/src/content/ui/adaptive-responsive/index.md)\n-   [bug\\_reportReport issue](https://github.com/flutter/website/issues/new?template=1_page_issue.yml&page-url=https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive&page-source=https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/src/content/ui/adaptive-responsive/index.md)\n![List of supported platforms](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/adaptive-responsive/platforms.png)\nOne of Flutter's primary goals is to create a framework that allows you to develop apps from a single codebase that look and feel great on any platform.\nThis means that your app might appear on screens of many different sizes, from a watch, to a foldable phone with two screens, to a high definition monitor. And your input device might be a physical or virtual keyboard, a mouse, a touchscreen, or any number of other devices.\nTwo terms that describe these design concepts are _adaptive_ and _responsive_. Ideally, you'd want your app to be _both_ but what, exactly, does this mean?\n## What is responsive vs adaptive?\n[#](#what-is-responsive-vs-adaptive)\nAn easy way to think about it is that responsive design is about fitting the UI _into_ the space and adaptive design is about the UI being _usable_ in the space.\nSo, a responsive app adjusts the placement of design elements to _fit_ the available space. And an adaptive app selects the appropriate layout and input devices to be usable _in_ the available space. For example, should a tablet UI use bottom navigation or side-panel navigation?\ninfoNote\nOften adaptive and responsive concepts are collapsed into a single term. Most often, _adaptive design_ is used to refer to both adaptive and responsive.\nThis section covers various aspects of adaptive and responsive design:\n-   [General approach](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/general)\n-   [SafeArea & MediaQuery](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/safearea-mediaquery)\n-   [Large screens & foldables](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/large-screens)\n-   [User input & accessibility](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/input)\n-   [Capabilities & policies](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/capabilities)\n-   [Best practices for adaptive apps](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/best-practices)\n-   [Additional resources](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/more-info)\ninfoNote\nYou might also check out the Google I/O 2024 talk about this subject.\n[Watch on YouTube in a new tab: \"How to build adaptive UI with Flutter\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch/LeKLGzpsz9I)\nWas this page's content helpful?\nthumb\\_up thumb\\_down\nUnless stated otherwise, the documentation on this site reflects Flutter 3.38.6.
