You have to:\n-   Define a constructor + properties\n-   Override `toString`, `operator ==`, `hashCode`\n-   Implement a `copyWith` method to clone the object\n-   Handle (de)serialization\nImplementing all of this can take hundreds of lines, which are error-prone and affect the readability of your model significantly.\nFreezed tries to fix that by implementing most of this for you, allowing you to focus on the definition of your model.\n| Before | After |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![before](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rrousselGit/freezed/refs/heads/master/resources/before.png) | ![before](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rrousselGit/freezed/master/resources/after.png) |\n# Index [#](#index)\n-   [Migration to 3.0.0](#migration-to-300)\n-   [Motivation](#motivation)\n-   [Index](#index)\n-   [How to use](#how-to-use)\n    -

  [Sponsors](#sponsors)\n# How to use [#](#how-to-use)\n## Install [#](#install)\nTo use [Freezed](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/freezed), you will need your typical [build\\_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner)/code-generator setup.\nFirst, install [build\\_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) and [Freezed](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/freezed) by adding them to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\nFor a Flutter project:\n```console\nflutter pub add \\\n  dev:build_runner \\\n  freezed_annotation \\\n  dev:freezed\n# if using freezed to generate fromJson/toJson, also add:\nflutter pub add json_annotation dev:json_serializable\n```\nFor a Dart project:\n```console\ndart pub add \\\n  dev:build_runner \\\n  freezed_annotation \\\n  dev:freezed\n# if using freezed to generate fromJson/toJson, also add:\ndart pub add json_annotation dev:json_serializable\n```\nThis installs three packages:\n-   [build\\_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner), the tool to run code-generators\n-   [freezed](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/freezed), the code generator\n-   [freezed\\_annotation](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed_annotation), a package containing annotations for [freezed](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/freezed).\n### Disabling invalid\\_annotation\\_target warning and warning in generates files [#](#disabling-invalid_annotation_target-warning-and-warning-in-generates-files)\nIf you plan on using [Freezed](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/freezed) in combination with `json_serializable`, recent versions of `json_serializable` and `meta` may require you to disable the `invalid_annotation_target` warning.\nTo do that, you can add the following to the `analysis_options.yaml` file at the root of your project:\n```yaml\nanalyzer:\n  errors:\n    invalid_annotation_target: ignore\n```\n## Run the generator [#](#run-the-generator)\nTo run the code generator, execute the following command:\n```\ndart run build_runner watch -d\n```\nNote that like most code-generators, [Freezed](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/freezed) will need you to both import the annotation ([freezed\\_annotation](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/freezed_annotation)) and use the `part` keyword on the top of your files.\nAs such, a file that wants to use [Freezed](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/freezed) will start with:\n```dart\nimport 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';\npart 'my_file.freezed.dart';\n```\n**CONSIDER** also importing `package:flutter/foundation.dart`.\nThe reason being, importing `foundation.dart` also imports classes to make an object nicely readable in Flutter's devtool.\nIf you import `foundation.dart`, [Freezed](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/freezed) will automatically do it for you.\n## Creating a Model using Freezed [#](#creating-a-model-using-freezed)\nFreezed offers two ways of creating data-classes:\n-   [Primary constructors](#primary-constructors) ; where you define a constructor and Freezed generates the associated fields. This is simulating the [Primary Constructor](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/2364) using `factory`.\n-   [Classic classes](#classic-classes), where you write a normal Dart class and Freezed only handles `toString/==/copyWith`\n### Primary constructors [#](#primary-constructors)\nFreezed implements Primary Constructors by relying on `factory` constructors. The idea is, you define a `factory` and Freezed generates everything else:\n```dart\nimport 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';\n// required: associates our `main.dart` with the code generated by Freezed\npart 'main.freezed.dart';\n// optional: Since our Person class is serializable, we must add this line.\n// But if Person was not serializable, we could skip it.\npart 'main.g.dart';\n@freezed\nabstract class Person with _$Person {\n  const factory Person({\n    required String firstName,\n    required String lastName,\n    required int age,\n  }) = _Person;\n  factory Person.fromJson(Map<String, Object?> json) => _$PersonFromJson(json);\n}\n```\nThe following snippet defines a model named `Person`:\n-   `Person` has 3 properties: `firstName`, `lastName` and `age`\n-   Because we are using `@freezed`, all of this class's properties are immutable.\n-   Since we defined a `fromJson`, this class is de/serializable. Freezed will add a `toJson` method for us.\n-   Freezed will also automatically generate:\n    -   a `copyWith` method, for cloning the object with different properties\n    -   a `toString` override listing all the properties of the object\n    -   an `operator ==` and `hashCode` override (since `Person` is immutable)\nFrom this example, we can notice a few things:\n-   It is necessary to annotate our model with `@freezed` (or `@Freezed`/`@unfreezed`, more about that later).\n    This annotation is what tells Freezed to generate code for that class.\n-   We must also apply a mixin with the name of our class, prefixed by `_$`. This mixin is what defines the various properties/methods of our object.\n-   When defining a constructor in a Freezed class, we should use the `factory` keyword as showcased (`const` is optional).\n    The parameters of this constructor will be the list of all properties that this class contains.\n    Parameters **don't** have to be named and required. Feel free to use positional optional parameters if you want!\n#### Adding getters and methods to our models\nSometimes, you may want to manually define methods/properties in our classes.\nBut you will quickly notice that if you try to use primary constructors:\n```dart\n@freezed\nabstract class Person with _$Person {\n  const factory Person(String name, {int? age}) = _Person;\n  void method() {\n    print('hello world');\n  }\n}\n```\nthen it will fail with the error `The non-abstract class _$_Person is missing implementations for these members:`.\nFor that to work, we need to define a private empty constructor. That will enable the generated code to _extend/subclass_ our class, instead of _implementing_ it (which is the default, and only inherits type, and not properties or methods):\n```dart\n@freezed\nabstract class Person with _$Person {\n  // Added constructor. Must not have any parameter\n  const Person._();\n  const factory Person(String name, {int? age}) = _Person;\n  void method() {\n    print('hello world');\n  }\n}\n```\n#### Asserts\nDart does not allow adding `assert(...)` statements to a `factory` constructor.\nAs such, to add asserts to your Freezed classes, you will need the `@Assert` decorator:\n```dart\n@freezed\nabstract class Person with _$Person {\n  @Assert('name.isNotEmpty', 'name cannot be empty')\n  const factory Person({required String name, int? age}) = _Person;\n}\n```\nAlternatively, you can specify a `MyClass._()` constructor:\n```dart\n@freezed\nabstract class Person with _$Person {\n  Person._({required this.name})\n    : assert(name.isNotEmpty, 'name cannot be empty');\n  factory Person({required String name, int? age}) = _Person;\n  @override\n  final String name;\n}\n```\n#### Default values\nSimilarly to asserts, Dart does not allow \"redirecting factory constructors\" to specify default values.\nAs such, if you want to specify default values for your properties, you will need the `@Default` annotation:\n```dart\n@freezed\nabstract class Example with _$Example {\n  const factory Example([@Default(42) int value]) = _Example;\n}\n```\n**NOTE**:\nIf you are using serialization/deserialization, this will automatically add a `@JsonKey(defaultValue: <something>)` for you.\n#### Non-constant default values\nIf using `@Default` is not enough, you have two options:\n-   Either stop using primary constructors. See [Classic Classes](#classic-classes)\n-   Add a `MyClass._()` constructor to initialize said value\nThe latter is particularly helpful when writing large models, as this doesn't require writing a lot of code just for one default values.\nOne example would be the following:\n```dart\n@freezed\nsealed class Response<T> with _$Response<T> {\n  // We give \"time\" parameters a non-constant default\n  Response._({DateTime? time}) : time = time ?? DateTime.now();\n  // Constructors may enable passing parameters to ._();\n  factory Response.data(T value, {DateTime? time}) = ResponseData;\n  // If ._ parameters are named and optional, factory constructors are not required to specify it\n  factory Response.error(Object error) = ResponseError;\n  @override\n  final DateTime time;\n}\n```\nIn this example, the field `time` is defaulting to `DateTime.now()`.\n#### Extending classes\nYou may want to have your Freezed class extend another class. Unfortunately, `factory` does not allow specifying `super(...)`.\nAs such, one workaround is to specify the `MyClass._()` again, similarly to how we used it for non-constant default values. Here's an example:\n```dart\nclass Subclass {\n  const Subclass.name(this.value);\n  final int value;\n}\n@freezed\nabstract class MyFreezedClass extends Subclass with _$MyFreezedClass {\n  // We can receive parameters in this constructor, which we can use with `super.field`\n  const MyFreezedClass._(super.value) : super.name();\n  const factory MyFreezedClass(int value, /* other fields */) = _MyFreezedClass;\n}\n```\nThis syntax gives full control over inheritance.\nOf course, you can also opt-out of `factory` constructors and write normal classes. See [Classic Classes](#classic-classes).\nIn general, this workaround makes more sense for [Unions](#union-types), where we have more than one `factory` constructor.\n#### Defining a mutable class instead of an immutable one\nSo far, we've seen how to define a model where all of its properties are `final`; but you may want to define mutable properties in your model.\nFreezed supports this, by replacing the `@freezed` annotation with `@unfreezed`:\n```dart\n@unfreezed\nabstract class Person with _$Person {\n  factory Person({\n    required String firstName,\n    required String lastName,\n    required final int age,\n  }) = _Person;\n  factory Person.fromJson(Map<String, Object?> json) => _$PersonFromJson(json);\n}\n```\nThis defines a model mostly identical to our previous snippets, but with the following differences:\n-   `firstName` and `lastName` are now mutable. As such, we can write:\n    ```dart\n    void main() {\n      var person = Person(firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Smith', age: 42);\n      person.firstName = 'Mona';\n      person.lastName = 'Lisa';\n    }\n    ```\n-   `age` is still immutable, because we explicitly marked the property as `final`.\n-   `Person` no-longer has a custom ==/hashCode implementation:\n    ```dart\n    void main() {\n      var john = Person(firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Smith', age: 42);\n      var john2 = Person(firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Smith', age: 42);\n      print(john == john2); // false\n    }\n    ```\n-   Of course, since our `Person` class is mutable, it is no-longer possible to instantiate it using `const`.\n#### Allowing the mutation of Lists/Maps/Sets\nBy default when using `@freezed` (but not `@unfreezed`), properties of type `List`/`Map`/`Set` are transformed to be immutable.\nThis means that writing the following will cause a runtime exception:\n```dart\n@freezed\nabstract class Example with _$Example {\n  factory Example(List<int> list) = _Example;\n}\nvoid main() {\n  var example = Example([]);\n  example.list.add(42); // throws because we are mutating a collection\n}\n```\nThat behavior can be disabled by writing:\n```dart\n@Freezed(makeCollectionsUnmodifiable: false)\nabstract class Example with _$Example {\n  factory Example(List<int> list) = _Example;\n}\nvoid main() {\n  var example = Example([]);\n  example.list.add(42); // OK\n}\n```\n### Classic classes [#](#classic-classes)\nInstead of primary constructors, you can write normal Dart classes.\nIn this scenario, write a typical constructor + fields combo as you normally would:\n```dart\nimport 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';\n// required: associates our `main.dart` with the code generated by Freezed\npart 'main.freezed.dart';\n// optional: Since our Person class is serializable, we must add this line.\n// But if Person was not serializable, we could skip it.\npart 'main.g.dart';\n@freezed\n@JsonSerializable()\nclass Person with _$Person {\n  const Person({\n    required this.firstName,\n    required this.lastName,\n    required this.age,\n  });\n  @override\n  final String firstName;\n  @override\n  final String lastName;\n  @override\n  final int age;\n  factory Person.fromJson(Map<String, Object?> json)\n      => _$PersonFromJson(json);\n  Map<String, Object?> toJson() => _$PersonToJson(this);\n}\n```\nIn this scenario, Freezed will generate `copyWith`/`toString`/`==`/`hashCode`, but won't do anything related to JSON encoding (hence why you need to manually add `@JsonSerializable`).\nThis syntax has the benefit of enabling advanced constructor logic, such as inheritance or non-constant default values.\n## How copyWith works [#](#how-copywith-works)\nAs explained before, when defining a model using Freezed, then the code-generator will automatically generate a `copyWith` method for us.\nThis method is used to clone an object with different values.\nFor example if we define:\n```dart\n@freezed\nabstract class Person with _$Person {\n  factory Person(String name, int? age) = _Person;\n}\n```\nThen we could write:\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  var person = Person('Remi', 24);\n  // `age` not passed, its value is preserved\n  print(person.copyWith(name: 'Dash')); // Person(name: Dash, age: 24)\n  // `age` is set to `null`\n  print(person.copyWith(age: null)); // Person(name: Remi, age: null)\n}\n```\nNotice Freezed supports `person.copyWith(age: null)`.\n### Going further: Deep copy [#](#going-further-deep-copy)\nWhile `copyWith` is very powerful in itself, it becomes inconvenient on more complex objects.\nConsider the following classes:\n```dart\n@freezed\nabstract class Company with _$Company {\n  const factory Company({String? name, required Director director}) = _Company;\n}\n@freezed\nabstract class Director with _$Director {\n  const factory Director({String? name, Assistant? assistant}) = _Director;\n}\n@freezed\nabstract class Assistant with _$Assistant {\n  const factory Assistant({String? name, int? age}) = _Assistant;\n}\n```\nThen, from a reference on `Company`, we may want to perform changes on `Assistant`.\nFor example, to change the `name` of an assistant, using `copyWith` we would have to write:\n```dart\nCompany company;\nCompany newCompany = company.copyWith(\n  director: company.director.copyWith(\n    assistant: company.director.assistant.copyWith(\n      name: 'John Smith',\n    ),\n  ),\n);\n```\nThis _works_, but is relatively verbose with a lot of duplicates.\nThis is where we could use [Freezed](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/freezed)'s \"deep copy\".\nIf a Freezed model contains properties that are also Freezed models, then the code-generator will offer an alternate syntax to the previous example:\n```dart\nCompany company;\nCompany newCompany = company.copyWith.director.assistant(name: 'John Smith');\n```\nThis snippet will achieve strictly the same result as the previous snippet (creating a new company with an updated assistant name), but no longer has duplicates.\nGoing deeper in this syntax, if instead, we wanted to change the director's name then we could write:\n```dart\nCompany company;\nCompany newCompany = company.copyWith.director(name: 'John Doe');\n```\nOverall, based on the definitions of `Company`/`Director`/`Assistant` mentioned above, all the following \"copy\" syntaxes will work:\n```dart\nCompany company;\ncompany = company.copyWith(name: 'Google', director: Director(...));\ncompany = company.copyWith.director(name: 'Larry', assistant: Assistant(...));\n```\n**Null consideration**\nSome objects may also be `null`. For example, using our `Company` class, then `Director`'s `assistant` may be `null`.\nAs such, writing:\n```dart\nCompany company = Company(name: 'Google', director: Director(assistant: null));\nCompany newCompany = company.copyWith.director.assistant(name: 'John');\n```\ndoesn't make sense.\nWe can't change the assistant's name if there is no assistant to begin with.\nIn that situation, `company.copyWith.director.assistant` will return `null`, causing our code to fail to compile.\nTo fix it, we can use the `?.call` operator and write:\n```dart\nCompany? newCompany = company.copyWith.director.assistant?.call(name: 'John');\n```\n## Decorators and comments [#](#decorators-and-comments)\n[Freezed](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/freezed) supports property and class level decorators/documentation by decorating/documenting their respective parameter and constructor definition.\nConsider:\n```dart\n@freezed\nabstract class Person with _$Person {\n  const factory Person({\n    String? name,\n    int? age,\n    Gender? gender,\n  }) = _Person;\n}\n```\nIf you want to document `name`, you can do:\n```dart\n@freezed\nabstract class Person with _$Person {\n  const factory Person({\n    /// The name of the user.\n    ///\n    /// Must not be null\n    String? name,\n    int? age,\n    Gender? gender,\n  }) = _Person;\n}\n```\nIf you want to mark the property `gender` as `@deprecated`, then you can do:\n```dart\n@freezed\nabstract class Person with _$Person {\n  const factory Person({\n    String? name,\n    int? age,\n    @deprecated Gender? gender,\n  }) = _Person;\n}\n```\nThis will deprecate both:\n-   The constructor\n    ```dart\n    Person(gender: Gender.something); // gender is deprecated\n    ```\n-   The generated class's constructor:\n    ```dart\n    _Person(gender: Gender.something); // gender is deprecated\n    ```\n-   the property:\n    ```dart\n    Person person;\n    print(person.gender); // gender is deprecated\n    ```\n-   the `copyWith` parameter:\n    ```dart\n    Person person;\n    person.copyWith(gender: Gender.something); // gender is deprecated\n    ```\nSimilarly, if you want to decorate the generated class you can decorate the defining factory constructor.\nAs such, to deprecate `_Person`, you could do:\n```dart\n@freezed\nabstract class Person with _$Person {\n  @deprecated\n  const factory Person({\n    String? name,\n    int? age,\n    Gender? gender,\n  }) = _Person;\n}\n```\n## FromJson/ToJson [#](#fromjsontojson)\nWhile [Freezed](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/freezed) will not generate your typical `fromJson`/`toJson` by itself, it knows what [json\\_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) is.\nMaking a class compatible with [json\\_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) is very straightforward.\nConsider this snippet:\n```dart\nimport 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';\npart 'model.freezed.dart';\n@freezed\nsealed class Model with _$Model {\n  factory Model.first(String a) = First;\n  factory Model.second(int b, bool c) = Second;\n}\n```\nThe changes necessary to make it compatible with [json\\_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) consists of two lines:\n-   a new `part`: `part 'model.g.dart';`\n-   a new constructor on the targeted class: `factory Model.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$ModelFromJson(json);`\nThe end result is:\n```dart\nimport 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';\npart 'model.freezed.dart';\npart 'model.g.dart';\n@freezed\nsealed class Model with _$Model {\n  factory Model.first(String a) = First;\n  factory Model.second(int b, bool c) = Second;\n  factory Model.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$ModelFromJson(json);\n}\n```\nDon't forget to add `json_serializable` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n```yaml\ndev_dependencies:\n  json_serializable:\n```\nThat's it!\nWith these changes, [Freezed](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/freezed) will automatically ask [json\\_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) to generate all the necessary `fromJson`/`toJson`.\n**Note**:\nFreezed will only generate a fromJson if the factory is using `=>`.\n### fromJSON - classes with multiple constructors [#](#fromjson---classes-with-multiple-constructors)\nFor classes with multiple constructors, [Freezed](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/freezed) will check the JSON response for a string element called `runtimeType` and choose the constructor to use based on its value. For example, given the following constructors:\n```dart\n@freezed\nsealed class MyResponse with _$MyResponse {\n  const factory MyResponse(String a) = MyResponseData;\n  const factory MyResponse.special(String a, int b) = MyResponseSpecial;\n  const factory MyResponse.error(String message) = MyResponseError;\n  factory MyResponse.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$MyResponseFromJson(json);\n}\n```\nThen [Freezed](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/freezed) will use each JSON object's `runtimeType` to choose the constructor as follows:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"runtimeType\": \"default\",\n    \"a\": \"This JSON object will use constructor MyResponse()\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"runtimeType\": \"special\",\n    \"a\": \"This JSON object will use constructor MyResponse.special()\",\n    \"b\": 42\n  },\n  {\n    \"runtimeType\": \"error\",\n    \"message\": \"This JSON object will use constructor MyResponse.error()\"\n  }\n]\n```\nYou can customize key and value with something different using `@Freezed` and `@FreezedUnionValue` decorators:\n```dart\n@Freezed(unionKey: 'type', unionValueCase: FreezedUnionCase.pascal)\nsealed class MyResponse with _$MyResponse {\n  const factory MyResponse(String a) = MyResponseData;\n  @FreezedUnionValue('SpecialCase')\n  const factory MyResponse.special(String a, int b) = MyResponseSpecial;\n  const factory MyResponse.error(String message) = MyResponseError;\n  factory MyResponse.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) =>\n      _$MyResponseFromJson(json);\n}\n```\nwhich would update the previous json to:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"Default\",\n    \"a\": \"This JSON object will use constructor MyResponse()\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"SpecialCase\",\n    \"a\": \"This JSON object will use constructor MyResponse.special()\",\n    \"b\": 42\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"Error\",\n    \"message\": \"This JSON object will use constructor MyResponse.error()\"\n  }\n]\n```\nIf you want to customize key and value for all the classes, you can specify it inside your `build.yaml` file, for example:\n```yaml\ntargets:\n  $default:\n    builders:\n      freezed:\n        options:\n          union_key: type\n          union_value_case: pascal\n```\nIf you don't control the JSON response, then you can implement a custom converter. Your custom converter will need to implement its own logic for determining which constructor to use.\n```dart\nclass MyResponseConverter implements JsonConverter<MyResponse, Map<String, dynamic>> {\n  const MyResponseConverter();\n  @override\n  MyResponse fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {\n    // type data was already set (e.g. because we serialized it ourselves)\n    if (json['runtimeType'] != null) {\n      return MyResponse.fromJson(json);\n    }\n    // you need to find some condition to know which type it is. e.g. check the presence of some field in the json\n    if (isTypeData) {\n      return MyResponseData.fromJson(json);\n    } else if (isTypeSpecial) {\n      return MyResponseSpecial.fromJson(json);\n    } else if (isTypeError) {\n      return MyResponseError.fromJson(json);\n    } else {\n      throw Exception('Could not determine the constructor for mapping from JSON');\n    }\n }\n  @override\n  Map<String, dynamic> toJson(MyResponse data) => data.toJson();\n}\n```\nTo then apply your custom converter pass the decorator to a constructor parameter.\n```dart\n@freezed\nabstract class MyModel with _$MyModel {\n  const factory MyModel(@MyResponseConverter() MyResponse myResponse) = MyModelData;\n  factory MyModel.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$MyModelFromJson(json);\n}\n```\nBy doing this, json serializable will use `MyResponseConverter.fromJson()` and `MyResponseConverter.toJson()` to convert `MyResponse`.\nYou can also use a custom converter on a constructor parameter contained in a `List`.\n```dart\n@freezed\nabstract class MyModel with _$MyModel {\n  const factory MyModel(@MyResponseConverter() List<MyResponse> myResponse) = MyModelData;\n  factory MyModel.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$MyModelFromJson(json);\n}\n```\n**Note**:\nIn order to serialize nested lists of freezed objects, you are supposed to either specify a `@JsonSerializable(explicitToJson: true)` or change `explicit_to_json` inside your `build.yaml` file ([see the documentation](https://github.com/google/json_serializable.dart/tree/master/json_serializable#build-configuration)).\n### Deserializing generic classes [#](#deserializing-generic-classes)\nIn order to de/serialize generic typed freezed objects, you can enable `genericArgumentFactories`.\nAll you need to do is to change the signature of the `fromJson` method and add `genericArgumentFactories: true` to the freezed configuration.\n```dart\n@Freezed(genericArgumentFactories: true)\nsealed class ApiResponse<T> with _$ApiResponse<T> {\n  const factory ApiResponse.data(T data) = ApiResponseData;\n  const factory ApiResponse.error(String message) = ApiResponseError;\n  factory ApiResponse.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json, T Function(Object?) fromJsonT) => _$ApiResponseFromJson(json, fromJsonT);\n}\n```\nAlternatively, you can enable `genericArgumentFactories` for the whole project by modifying your `build.yaml` file to include the following:\n```yaml\ntargets:\n  $default:\n    builders:\n      freezed:\n        options:\n          generic_argument_factories: true\n```\n**What about `@JsonKey` annotation?**\nAll decorators passed to a constructor parameter are \"copy-pasted\" to the generated property too.\nAs such, you can write:\n```dart\n@freezed\nabstract class Example with _$Example {\n  factory Example(@JsonKey(name: 'my_property') String myProperty) = _Example;\n  factory Example.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$ExampleFromJson(json);\n}\n```\n**What about `@JsonSerializable` annotation?**\nYou can pass `@JsonSerializable` annotation by placing it over constructor e.g.:\n```dart\n@freezed\nabstract class Example with _$Example {\n  @JsonSerializable(explicitToJson: true)\n  factory Example(@JsonKey(name: 'my_property') SomeOtherClass myProperty) = _Example;\n  factory Example.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$ExampleFromJson(json);\n}\n```\nIf you want to define some custom json\\_serializable flags for all the classes (e.g. `explicit_to_json` or `any_map`) you can do it via `build.yaml` file as described [here](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable#build-configuration).\nSee also the [decorators](#decorators-and-comments) section\n## Union types [#](#union-types)\nComing from other languages, you may be used to features like \"union types,\" \"sealed classes,\" and pattern matching.\nThese are powerful tools in combination with a type system, but it isn't particularly ergonomic to use them in Dart.\nBut fear not, [Freezed](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/freezed) supports them, generating a few utilities to help you!\nLong story short, in any Freezed class, you can write multiple constructors:\n```dart\n@freezed\nsealed class Union with _$Union {\n  const factory Union.data(int value) = Data;\n  const factory Union.loading() = Loading;\n  const factory Union.error([String? message]) = Error;\n}\n```\nBy doing this, our model now can be in different mutually exclusive states.\nIn particular, this snippet defines a model `Union`, and that model has 3 possible states:\n-   data\n-   loading\n-   error\nNote how we gave meaningful names to the right hand of the factory constructors we defined. They will come in handy later.\nOne thing you may also notice is that with this example, we can no longer write code such as:\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  Union union = Union.data(42);\n  print(union.value); // compilation error: property value does not exist\n}\n```\nWe'll see why in the following section.\n### Shared properties [#](#shared-properties)\nWhen defining multiple constructors, you will lose the ability to read properties that are not common to all constructors:\nFor example, if you write:\n```dart\n@freezed\nsealed class Example with _$Example {\n  const factory Example.person(String name, int age) = Person;\n  const factory Example.city(String name, int population) = City;\n}\n```\nThen you will be unable to read `age` and `population` directly:\n```dart\nvar example = Example.person('Remi', 24);\nprint(example.age); // does not compile!\n```\nOn the other hand, you **can** read properties that are defined on all constructors. For example, the `name` variable is common to both `Example.person` and `Example.city` constructors.\nAs such we can write:\n```dart\nvar example = Example.person('Remi', 24);\nprint(example.name); // Remi\nexample = Example.city('London', 8900000);\nprint(example.name); // London\n```\nThe same logic can be applied to `copyWith` too.\nWe can use `copyWith` with properties defined on all constructors:\n```dart\nvar example = Example.person('Remi', 24);\nprint(example.copyWith(name: 'Dash')); // Example.person(name: Dash, age: 24)\nexample = Example.city('London', 8900000);\nprint(example.copyWith(name: 'Paris')); // Example.city(name: Paris, population: 8900000)\n```\nOn the other hand, properties that are unique to a specific constructor aren't available:\n```dart\nvar example = Example.person('Remi', 24);\nexample.copyWith(age: 42); // compilation error, parameter `age` does not exist\n```\nTo solve this problem, we need check the state of our object using what we call \"pattern matching\".\n### Using pattern matching to read non-shared properties [#](#using-pattern-matching-to-read-non-shared-properties)\nFor this section, let's consider the following union:\n```dart\n@freezed\nsealed class Example with _$Example {\n  const factory Example.person(String name, int age) = Person;\n  const factory Example.city(String name, int population) = City;\n}\n```\nLet's see how we can use pattern matching to read the content of an `Example` instance.\nFor this, you should use Dart’s built-in pattern matching using `switch`:\n```dart\nswitch (example) {\n  Person(:final name) => print('Person $name'),\n  City(:final population) => print('City ($population)'),\n}\n```\nAlternatively, you could use an `if`\\-`case` statement:\n```dart\nif (example case Person(:final name)) {\n  print('Person $name');\n} else if (example case City(:final population)) {\n  print('City ($population)');\n}\n```\nYou could also use `is`/`as` to cast an `Example` variable into either a `Person` or a `City`, but this is heavily discouraged. Use one of the other two options.\n### Mixins and Interfaces for individual classes for union types [#](#mixins-and-interfaces-for-individual-classes-for-union-types)\nWhen you have multiple types in the same class you might want one of those types to implement an interface or mixin a class. You can do that using the `@Implements` or `@With` decorators respectively. In the following example `City` implements `GeographicArea`.\n```dart\nabstract class GeographicArea {\n  int get population;\n  String get name;\n}\n@freezed\nsealed class Example with _$Example {\n  const factory Example.person(String name, int age) = Person;\n  @Implements<GeographicArea>()\n  const factory Example.city(String name, int population) = City;\n}\n```\nThis also works for implementing or mixing in generic classes e.g. `AdministrativeArea<House>` except when the class has a generic type parameter e.g. `AdministrativeArea<T>`. In this case freezed will generate correct code but dart will throw a load error on the annotation declaration when compiling. To avoid this you should use the `@Implements.fromString` and `@With.fromString` decorators as follows:\n```dart\nabstract class GeographicArea {}\nabstract class House {}\nabstract class Shop {}\nabstract class AdministrativeArea<T> {}\n@freezed\nsealed class Example<T> with _$Example<T> {\n  const factory Example.person(String name, int age) = Person<T>;\n  @With.fromString('AdministrativeArea<T>')\n  const factory Example.street(String name) = Street<T>;\n  @With<House>()\n  @Implements<Shop>()\n  @Implements<GeographicArea>()\n  @Implements.fromString('AdministrativeArea<T>')\n  const factory Example.city(String name, int population) = City<T>;\n}\n```\n**Note**: You need to make sure that you comply with the interface requirements by implementing all the abstract members. If the interface has no members or just fields, you can fulfill the interface contract by adding them to the union type's constructor. Keep in mind that if the interface defines a method or a getter, that you implement in the class, you need to use the [Adding getters and methods to our models](#adding-getters-and-methods-to-our-models) instructions.\n**Note 2**: You cannot use `@With`/`@Implements` with freezed classes. Freezed classes can neither be extended nor implemented.\n### Ejecting an individual union case [#](#ejecting-an-individual-union-case)\nTo have fine-grained control over your models, Freezed offer the ability to manually write a subclass of a union.\nConsider:\n```dart\n@freezed\nsealed class Result<T> with _$Result {\n  factory Result.data(T data) = ResultData;\n  factory Result.error(Object error) = ResultError;\n}\n```\nNow, let's say we wanted to write `ResultData` ourselves. For that, simply define a `ResultData` class in the same file:\n```dart\n@freezed\nsealed class Result<T> with _$Result {\n  factory Result.data(T data) = ResultData;\n  factory Result.error(Object error) = ResultError;\n}\nclass ResultData<T> implements Result<T> {\n  // TODO: implement Result<T>\n}\n```\nNote that the extracted class can be a Freezed class too!\n```dart\n@freezed\nsealed class Result<T> with _$Result<T> {\n  const Result._();\n  const factory Result.data(T data) = ResultData;\n  const factory Result.error(Object error) = ResultError;\n}\n// TODO maybe add some methods unique to ResultData\n@freezed\nabstract class ResultData<T> extends Result<T> with _$ResultData<T> {\n  const factory ResultData(T data) = _ResultData;\n  const ResultData._() : super._();\n}\n```\n#### (Legacy) Pattern matching utilities\nWarning\nAs of Dart 3, Dart now has built-in pattern-matching using sealed classes. As such, you no-longer need to rely on Freezed's generated methods for pattern matching. Instead of using `when`/`map`, use the official Dart syntax.\nThe references to `when`/`map` are kept for users who have yet to migrate to Dart 3. But in the long term, you should stop relying on them and migrate to `switch` expressions.\n##### When\nThe \\[when\\] method is the equivalent to pattern matching with destructuring.\nThe prototype of the method depends on the constructors defined.\nFor example, with:\n```dart\n@freezed\nsealed class Union with _$Union {\n  const factory Union(int value) = Data;\n  const factory Union.loading() = Loading;\n  const factory Union.error([String? message]) = ErrorDetails;\n}\n```\nThen \\[when\\] will be:\n```dart\nvar union = Union(42);\nprint(\n  union.when(\n    (int value) => 'Data $value',\n    loading: () => 'loading',\n    error: (String? message) => 'Error: $message',\n  ),\n); // Data 42\n```\nWhereas if we defined:\n```dart\n@freezed\nsealed class Model with _$Model {\n  factory Model.first(String a) = First;\n  factory Model.second(int b, bool c) = Second;\n}\n```\nThen \\[when\\] will be:\n```dart\nvar model = Model.first('42');\nprint(\n  model.when(\n    first: (String a) => 'first $a',\n    second: (int b, bool c) => 'second $b $c'\n  ),\n); // first 42\n```\nNotice how each callback matches with a constructor's name and prototype.\n##### Map\nThe \\[map\\] methods are equivalent to \\[when\\], but **without** destructuring.\nConsider this class:\n```dart\n@freezed\nsealed class Model with _$Model {\n  factory Model.first(String a) = First;\n  factory Model.second(int b, bool c) = Second;\n}\n```\nWith such class, while \\[when\\] will be:\n```dart\nvar model = Model.first('42');\nprint(\n  model.when(\n    first: (String a) => 'first $a',\n    second: (int b, bool c) => 'second $b $c'\n  ),\n); // first 42\n```\n\\[map\\] will instead be:\n```dart\nvar model = Model.first('42');\nprint(\n  model.map(\n    first: (First value) => 'first ${value.a}',\n    second: (Second value) => 'second ${value.b} ${value.c}'\n  ),\n); // first 42\n```\nThis can be useful if you want to do complex operations, like \\[copyWith\\]/`toString` for example:\n```dart\nvar model = Model.second(42, false)\nprint(\n  model.map(\n    first: (value) => value,\n    second: (value) => value.copyWith(c: true),\n  )\n); // Model.second(b: 42, c: true)\n```\n## Configurations [#](#configurations)\nFreezed offers various options to customize the generated code. To do so, there are two possibilities:\n### Changing the behavior for a specific model [#](#changing-the-behavior-for-a-specific-model)\nIf you want to customize the generated code for only one specific class, you can do so by using a different annotation:\n```dart\n@Freezed()\nabstract class Person with _$Person {\n  factory Person(String name, int age) = _Person;\n}\n```\nBy doing so, you can now pass various parameters to `@Freezed` to change the output:\n```dart\n@Freezed(\n  // Disable the generation of copyWith/==\n  copyWith: false,\n  equal: false,\n)\n abstract class Person with _$Person {...}\n```\nTo view all the possibilities, see the documentation of `@Freezed`: [https://pub.dev/documentation/freezed\\_annotation/latest/freezed\\_annotation/Freezed-class.html](https://pub.dev/documentation/freezed_annotation/latest/freezed_annotation/Freezed-class.html)\n### Changing the behavior for the entire project [#](#changing-the-behavior-for-the-entire-project)\nInstead of applying your modification to a single class, you may want to apply it to all Freezed models at the same time.\nYou can do so by customizing a file called `build.yaml`\nThis file is an optional configuration file that should be placed next to your `pubspec.yaml`:\n```\nmy_project_folder/\n  pubspec.yaml\n  build.yaml\n  lib/\n```\nThere, you will be able to change the same options as the options found in `@Freezed` (see above) by writing:\n```yaml\ntargets:\n  $default:\n    builders:\n      freezed:\n        options:\n          # Tells Freezed to format .freezed.dart files.\n          # This can significantly slow down code-generation.\n          # Disabling formatting will only work when opting into Dart 3.7 as a minimum\n          # in your project SDK constraints.\n          format: true\n          # Disable the generation of copyWith/== for the entire project\n          copy_with: false\n          equal: false\n```\n# Utilities [#](#utilities)\n## IDE Extensions [#](#ide-extensions)\n### Freezed extension for VSCode [#](#freezed-extension-for-vscode)\nThe [Freezed](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blaxou.freezed) extension might help you work faster with freezed.

custom_lint\n```\n## Third-party tools [#](#third-party-tools)\nThis part contains community-made tools which integrate with Freezed.\n### DartJ [#](#dartj)\n[DartJ](https://dartj.web.app/#/) is Flutter application, made by [**@ttpho**](https://github.com/ttpho), which will generate the Freezed classes from a JSON payload.\nExample:\n[https://github.com/ttpho/ttpho/assets/3994863/5d529258-c02c-4066-925e-ca2ffc68a804](https://github.com/ttpho/ttpho/assets/3994863/5d529258-c02c-4066-925e-ca2ffc68a804)\n## Sponsors [#](#sponsors)\n[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rrousselGit/freezed/master/sponsorkit/sponsors.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rrousselGit/freezed/master/sponsorkit/sponsors.svg)\n[\n4.44k\nlikes\n160\npoints\n1.48M\ndownloads\n](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed/score)\n### Publisher\n[![verified publisher](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/material-icon-verified.svg \"Published by a pub.dev verified publisher\")dash-overflow.net](https://pub.dev/publishers/dash-overflow.net)\n### Weekly Downloads\n### Metadata\nCode generation for immutable classes that has a simple syntax/API without compromising on the features.\n[Repository (GitHub)](https://github.com/rrousselGit/freezed)\n[View/report issues](https://github.com/rrousselGit/freezed/issues)\n### Documentation\n[API reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/freezed/latest/)\n### License\n![](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/material-icon-balance.svg)MIT ([license](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed/license))\n### Dependencies\n[analyzer](https://pub.dev/packages/analyzer \"^9.0.0\"), [build](https://pub.dev/packages/build \">=3.0.0 <5.0.0\"), [build\\_config](https://pub.dev/packages/build_config \"^1.1.0\"), [collection](https://pub.dev/packages/collection \"^1.15.0\"), [dart\\_style](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_style \"^3.0.0\"), [freezed\\_annotation](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed_annotation \"3.1.0\"), [json\\_annotation](https://pub.dev/packages/json_annotation \"^4.8.0\"), [meta](https://pub.dev/packages/meta \"^1.9.1\"), [pub\\_semver](https://pub.dev/packages/pub_semver \"^2.2.0\"), [source\\_gen](https://pub.dev/packages/source_gen \">=3.0.0 <5.0.0\")\n### More\n[Packages that depend on freezed](https://pub.dev/packages?q=dependency%3Afreezed)\n### ← Metadata\n[\n4.44k\nlikes\n160\npoints\n1.48M\ndownloads\n](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed/score)\n### Publisher\n[![verified publisher](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/material-icon-verified.svg \"Published by a pub.dev verified publisher\")dash-overflow.net](https://pub.dev/publishers/dash-overflow.net)\n### Weekly Downloads\n### Metadata\nCode generation for immutable classes that has a simple syntax/API without compromising on the features.\n[Repository (GitHub)](https://github.com/rrousselGit/freezed)\n[View/report issues](https://github.com/rrousselGit/freezed/issues)\n### Documentation\n[API reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/freezed/latest/)\n### License\n![](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/material-icon-balance.svg)MIT ([license](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed/license))\n### Dependencies\n[analyzer](https://pub.dev/packages/analyzer \"^9.0.0\"), [build](https://pub.dev/packages/build \">=3.0.0 <5.0.0\"), [build\\_config](https://pub.dev/packages/build_config \"^1.1.0\"), [collection](https://pub.dev/packages/collection \"^1.15.0\"), [dart\\_style](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_style \"^3.0.0\"), [freezed\\_annotation](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed_annotation \"3.1.0\"), [json\\_annotation](https://pub.dev/packages/json_annotation \"^4.8.0\"), [meta](https://pub.dev/packages/meta \"^1.9.1\"), [pub\\_semver](https://pub.dev/packages/pub_semver \"^2.2.0\"), [source\\_gen](https://pub.dev/packages/source_gen \">=3.0.0 <5.0.0\")\n### More\n[Packages that depend on freezed](https://pub.dev/packages?q=dependency%3Afreezed)\nBack\n![previous](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/keyboard_arrow_left.svg)\n![next](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/keyboard_arrow_right.svg)\n[Dart language](https://dart.dev/)[Report package](https://pub.dev/report?subject=package%3Afreezed&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpub.dev%2Fpackages%2Ffreezed)[Policy](https://pub.dev/policy)[Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)[API Terms](https://developers.google.com/terms/)[Security](https://pub.dev/security)[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/)[Help](https://pub.dev/help)[![RSS](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/rss-feed-icon.svg \"RSS/atom feed\")](https://pub.dev/feed.atom)[![bug report](https://pub.dev/static/hash-jnfujih4/img/bug-report-white-96px.png \"Report an issue with this site\")](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub-dev/issues/new)",
