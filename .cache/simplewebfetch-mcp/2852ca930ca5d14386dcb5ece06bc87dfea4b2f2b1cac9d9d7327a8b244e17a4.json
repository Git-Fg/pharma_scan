[Mocking](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/unit/mocking)\n# Mock dependencies using Mockito\nUse the Mockito package to mimic the behavior of services for testing.\nmore\\_vert\n-   copyCopy link\n-   [docsView source](https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/src/content/cookbook/testing/unit/mocking.md)\n-   [bug\\_reportReport issue](https://github.com/flutter/website/issues/new?template=1_page_issue.yml&page-url=https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/unit/mocking&page-source=https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/src/content/cookbook/testing/unit/mocking.md)\nSometimes, unit tests might depend on classes that fetch data from live web services or databases. This is inconvenient for a few reasons:\n-   Calling live services or databases slows down test execution.\n-   A passing test might start failing if a web service or database returns unexpected results. This is known as a \"flaky test.\"\n-   It is difficult to test all possible success and failure scenarios by using a live web service or database.\nTherefore, rather than relying on a live web service or database, you can \"mock\" these dependencies. Mocks allow emulating a live web service or database and return specific results depending on the situation.\nGenerally speaking, you can mock dependencies by creating an alternative implementation of a class. Write these alternative implementations by hand or make use of the [Mockito package](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito) as a shortcut.\nThis recipe demonstrates the basics of mocking with the Mockito package using the following steps:\n1.  Add the package dependencies.\n2.  Create a function to test.\n3.  Create a test file with a mock `http.Client`.\n4.  Write a test for each condition.\n5.  Run the tests.\nFor more information, see the [Mockito package](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito) documentation.\n## 1\\. Add the package dependencies\n[#](#1-add-the-package-dependencies)\nTo use the `mockito` package, add it to the `pubspec.yaml` file along with the `flutter_test` dependency in the `dev_dependencies` section.\nThis example also uses the `http` package, so define that dependency in the `dependencies` section.\n`mockito: 5.0.0` supports Dart's null safety thanks to code generation. To run the required code generation, add the `build_runner` dependency in the `dev_dependencies` section.\nTo add the dependencies, run `flutter pub add`:\n```\n$ flutter pub add http dev:mockito dev:build_runner\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n## 2\\. Create a function to test\n[#](#2-create-a-function-to-test)\nIn this example, unit test the `fetchAlbum` function from the [Fetch data from the internet](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/fetch-data) recipe. To test this function, make two changes:\n1.  Provide an `http.Client` to the function. This allows providing the correct `http.Client` depending on the situation. For Flutter and server-side projects, provide an `http.IOClient`. For Browser apps, provide an `http.BrowserClient`. For tests, provide a mock `http.Client`.\n2.  Use the provided `client` to fetch data from the internet, rather than the static `http.get()` method, which is difficult to mock.\nThe function should now look like this:\ndart\n```\nFuture<Album> fetchAlbum(http.Client client) async {\n  final response = await client.get(\n    Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums/1'),\n  );\n​\n  if (response.statusCode == 200) {\n    // If the server did return a 200 OK response,\n    // then parse the JSON.\n    return Album.fromJson(jsonDecode(response.body) as Map<String, dynamic>);\n  } else {\n    // If the server did not return a 200 OK response,\n    // then throw an exception.\n    throw Exception('Failed to load album');\n  }\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nIn your app code, you can provide an `http.Client` to the `fetchAlbum` method directly with `fetchAlbum(http.Client())`. `http.Client()` creates a default `http.Client`.\n## 3\\. Create a test file with a mock `http.Client`\n[#](#3-create-a-test-file-with-a-mock-http-client)\nNext, create a test file.\nFollowing the advice in the [Introduction to unit testing](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/unit/introduction) recipe, create a file called `fetch_album_test.dart` in the root `test` folder.\nAdd the annotation `@GenerateMocks([], customMocks: [MockSpec<http.Client>(as: #MockHttpClient)])` to the main function to generate a `MockHttpClient` class with `mockito`.\nThe generated `MockHttpClient` class implements the `http.Client` class. This allows you to pass the `MockHttpClient` to the `fetchAlbum` function, and return different http responses in each test.\nThe generated mocks will be located in `fetch_album_test.mocks.dart`. Import this file to use them.\ndart\n```\nimport 'package:http/http.dart' as http;\nimport 'package:mocking/main.dart';\nimport 'package:mockito/annotations.dart';\n​\n// Generate a MockClient using the Mockito package.\n// Create new instances of this class in each test.\n// Note: Naming the generated mock `MockHttpClient` to avoid confusion with\n// `MockClient` from `package:http/testing.dart`.\n@GenerateMocks([], customMocks: [MockSpec<http.Client>(as: #MockHttpClient)])\nvoid main() {\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\nNext, generate the mocks running the following command:\n```\n$ dart run build_runner build\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n## 4\\. Write a test for each condition\n[#](#4-write-a-test-for-each-condition)\nThe `fetchAlbum()` function does one of two things:\n1.  Returns an `Album` if the http call succeeds\n2.  Throws an `Exception` if the http call fails\nTherefore, you want to test these two conditions. Use the `MockHttpClient` class to return an \"Ok\" response for the success test, and an error response for the unsuccessful test. Test these conditions using the `when()` function provided by Mockito:\ndart\n```\nimport 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';\nimport 'package:http/http.dart' as http;\nimport 'package:mocking/main.dart';\nimport 'package:mockito/annotations.dart';\nimport 'package:mockito/mockito.dart';\n​\nimport 'fetch_album_test.mocks.dart';\n​\n// Generate a MockClient using the Mockito package.\n// Create new instances of this class in each test.\n// Note: Naming the generated mock `MockHttpClient` to avoid confusion with\n// `MockClient` from `package:http/testing.dart`.\n@GenerateMocks([], customMocks: [MockSpec<http.Client>(as: #MockHttpClient)])\nvoid main() {\n  group('fetchAlbum', () {\n    test('returns an Album if the http call completes successfully', () async {\n      final client = MockHttpClient();\n​\n      // Use Mockito to return a successful response when it calls the\n      // provided http.Client.\n      when(\n        client.get(Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums/1')),\n      ).thenAnswer(\n        (_) async =>\n            http.Response('{\"userId\": 1, \"id\": 2, \"title\": \"mock\"}', 200),\n      );\n​\n      expect(await fetchAlbum(client), isA<Album>());\n    });\n​\n    test('throws an exception if the http call completes with an error', () {\n      final client = MockHttpClient();\n​\n      // Use Mockito to return an unsuccessful response when it calls the\n      // provided http.Client.\n      when(\n        client.get(Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums/1')),\n      ).thenAnswer((_) async => http.Response('Not Found', 404));\n​\n      expect(fetchAlbum(client), throwsException);\n    });\n  });\n}\n```\ncontent\\_copy\n## 5\\.

This is only a short introduction to the Mockito library and the concept of mocking.
