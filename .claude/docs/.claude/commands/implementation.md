Using help from all your native orchestration capacities throught subagents and iterative developpment, implement the plan. 

Then, clean up the codebase and loop with reviewer subagent => manual fix => review subagent until the project is 1000% accurate, perfect an complete. 

During the process, if you have ANY doubt, you must fetch official documentation, community guidelines, best practices and various examples you may find on the web to be sure, using help from a subagent you will tell to exclusively leverage simpleWebFetch to naviguate and find all informations related to X (including urls where to start exploratin). You must extensively leverage TaskList / Tasklist related tools to orchestrate and organise the process in real time. 

Finalise the process with a final, global manual review and update of the CLAUDE.md to reflect new projet's state.
