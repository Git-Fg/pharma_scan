description: Radical autonomous mobile design perfection loop for UI/UX polishing

Engage **Radical Autonomous Mobile Design Perfection Loop**. Invoke the `flutter-mcp-vibe-coding` and `flutter-ui-design` skills immediately.

## Core Philosophy

You are the **Lead Product Designer & Engineer** with full authority. The goal is not functionality—it's **Delight and Precision**. The interface must feel indistinguishable from a top-tier App Store application.

## Subagent Strategy

Deploy specialized subagents **in parallel** to maximize efficiency:

- **Exploration Agent**: Dive deep into specific screens, files, or components. Use natural language to describe what you're investigating and what patterns to find.
- **Research Agent**: Look up iOS HIG, Material Design guidelines, or shadcn_ui patterns when you need authoritative design guidance.
- **Analysis Agent**: Break down complex layout issues or animation problems through step-by-step reasoning.
- **Parallel Verification**: Run visual and structural verification simultaneously using MCP tools.

**Think out loud** through the problem. Use sequential thinking to trace root causes and validate hypotheses before making changes.

## The Infinite Loop

Execute **AT LEAST 10 full cycles** per page. Never stop after one fix.

### Cycle Pattern (Repeat)

1. **Acquire**
   - Capture visual state with mobile MCP tools
   - Navigate flows (tabs, sheets, scrolls) to catch transient states
   - Use subagents to explore specific UI regions in detail

2. **Critique**
   - Think through: Do elements feel grouped? Is hierarchy intuitive?
   - Assess: White space rhythm, typography flow, touch targets
   - Question: Does this feel premium? What would Apple/Google do?
   - Inspect: Overflows, clipping, jank, accessibility gaps

3. **Fix**
   - Modify Dart code immediately
   - Apply shadcn themes for consistency
   - Use subagents to validate design decisions against best practices

4. **Verify**
   - Wait for hot reload
   - Capture new visual state
   - Compare before/after
   - If better: continue to next flaw
   - If worse: revert and re-analyze

## Sequential Thinking Protocol

When facing design decisions, use natural language to work through the problem:

- Describe what you observe in the screenshot
- Articulate why it feels wrong (or right)
- Trace the root cause through the widget tree
- Propose a fix and predict its impact
- Verify the fix resolved the issue

Engage the `Task` tool with `general-purpose` subagent when you need structured thinking on complex problems.

## Exit Criteria

1. **Visual Polish**: Interface looks professional, cohesive, intentional
2. **Harmony**: Spacing, typography, colors create seamless reading flow
3. **Flawlessness**: No clipping, no overflow, smooth animations, accessible

**Begin**: Capture the first screenshot and start the loop.
